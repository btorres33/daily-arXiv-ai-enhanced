The huge size becomes a limiting factor for broader adoption, and\nits fast growth rate will soon exhaust all the available storage devices. To\naddress these issues, we present EBCC (Error Bounded Climate-data Compressor).\nIt follows a two-layer approach: a base compression layer using JPEG2000 to\ncapture the bulk of the data with a high compression ratio, and a residual\ncompression layer using wavelet transform and SPIHT encoding to efficiently\neliminate long-tail extreme errors introduced by the base compression layer. It\nincorporates a feedback rate-control mechanism for both layers that adjusts\ncompression ratios to achieve the specified maximum error target. We evaluate\nEBCC alongside other established compression methods on benchmarks related to\nweather and climate science including error statistics, a case study on\nprimitive and derived variables near a hurricane, evaluation of the closure of\nthe global energy budget, and a Lagrangian air parcel trajectory simulation.\nThis is the first time that trajectory simulation is used to benchmark\ncompression methods. Our method concentrates most errors near zero, while\nothers tend to distribute errors uniformly within the error bound. EBCC\noutperforms other methods in the benchmarks at relative error targets ranging\nfrom 0.1% to 10% and achieves compression ratios from 15x to more than 300x. In\nthe energy budget closure and Lagrangian trajectory benchmarks, it can achieve\nmore than 100x compression while keeping errors within natural variability\nderived from ERA5 uncertainty members.

To address\nthis gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of\nmulti-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level\nadaptive loss function.We begin by defining the \"Modality Gap\" as the\ndifference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and\nvisual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap\ndistribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM).

While\ncentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a\ncentral coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer\nfrom scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed\nTraining with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed\nlearning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and\nlimited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion\nModel Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.\nBuilt upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP\nemploys Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future\ntrajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby\nalleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE\nmethods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field\n(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This\ndesign mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with\nminimal communication overhead in distributed settings.

While meta-reinforcement\nlearning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to\nlearn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This\nrepresentational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and\ngeneralization capacity.

Through state\nmachine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently\ngenerates more interpretable representations that better approximate\nBayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide\nvariety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks\nrequiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules\nsuccessfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional\nmeta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning.

Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract\nand compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with\nLLMs generating human-readable descriptions.

To control model complexity, we\nplace a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to\nevolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled\nwith a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.\nThis yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop\na scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection\nmatrices and JGP hyperparameters.

Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes.

A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the\nexpected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We\nanalyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is\na state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query\ncost and prediction losses.

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field.

Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they\nprimarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly\ncompromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating\nautomated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a\nfundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each\nindividual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between\nactivation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability\nanalysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.\nTherefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated\ncomponents while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.\nPAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\\% and memory consumption by\nup to 30\\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.\nImportantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit\ndiscovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism.

To address these challenges, we\npresent Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework\ndesigned for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.\nSpecifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate\nsignals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative\npolicy optimization (Tree-GRPO) integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into GRPO.\nTo generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting autonomous\nadaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce Multi-modal\nGenerative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the effectiveness of\nSEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmethods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 46.27% (multi-modal), outperforming\nprior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also achieves scores of 80.3% (textual)\nand 44.03% (multi-modal) without ground truth reward, surpassing all\nopen-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving\nembodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support\nthe potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence."}

Most existing data valuation\nmethods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating\nchanges in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as\nopposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different\npatterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods\nbased on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when\nthe validation set contains no OOD data.

A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over\nwireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to\nadversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is\nparticularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models\n(LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors\nessential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are\nprovided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an\nexpression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is\nupper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a\nphysical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM)\nover wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather\ninformation on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of\ndevising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly\noptimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive\nexperiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness,\nachieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language\nprocessing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The\nproposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component,\nwhere controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model's resilience\nto perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more\nnoise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially\nwhen resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in\nparticular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the\nneed for jamming-resilient SFL protocols."}

Many existing interpretability are limited in\nthis area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward\npasses of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold\nduring reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence\nlevel is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We\nintroduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model,\nfiltering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought\nfrom that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution\nof final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized\nimpact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these\nsentences \\textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty\nmanagement sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from\nsubsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining\nsentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a\nmodel's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's\ndifficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or\ndiffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques\ntogether provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by\nconducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math\nproblem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the\nreasoning trace's structure.

This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of\nmultiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent\nstate space.

To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel\n''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant\nmulti-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our\nmethod applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its\nsingular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix\nbecomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert\ncorresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the\ncorresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a\nlearnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts'\northogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix.\nThese two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among\nthe new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively.

Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific\ntime series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures\nsuch as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical\nsimulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC\noutperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational\noverhead.

Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training\nsetups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which\ndirection - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what\nwe measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation\nframework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary\ndimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive\nUncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,\nand Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -\nthe relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on\nmodel capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples\nat different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task\ndemands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final\nrepresentations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate\ninternal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the\nnotion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across\nmodel and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing\ndecision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes."}
