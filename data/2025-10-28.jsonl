However, this mechanism has so far only been studied\ntheoretically under ideal conditions. In this work, we perform numerical\nstudies on more realistic situations. In particular, we focus on a scenario\nwhere the laser is obliquely incident on the target surface to avoid the\npotential damage of the optics by the reflected light. We demonstrate that\nincreasing oblique incidence angle, reducing target thickness, and improving\nlaser contrast can enhance the harmonic conversion efficiency. However, the\ngenerated harmonic beams may contain both Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) (vortex) and\nnon-LG components under non-ideal conditions. We show that they can be\nseparated by their divergence, as the vortex components has smaller diverging\nangle. In addition, we have performed computational analyses on the harmonic\ndivergence angles and topological charge spectra of vortex high-order harmonics\nunder different conditions. These high-order harmonic pure LG modes can\npotentially be filtered out for wide range of fundamental and applied physics\nresearches. This study provides valuable insights for the design and\nimplementation of future experiments."}

The propagator is\nessentially a Green function for the neutral kinetic equation, which depends on\nthe plasma profiles. A Neural Network (NN) based model for the propagator\nprovides a fast and accurate solution for the neutral distribution function in\nplasma. Furthermore, continuous and smooth dependence of NN-based\nreconstruction of the propagator on the plasma parameters opens the possibility\nfor using this approach with Jacobian-based methods for time-integration and\nroot finding. Initial results from a small 1D test problem look promising;\nhowever, important research questions are concerned with the scaling of the\nalgorithm to larger systems."}

The BTOF has a series of wavelength resonant reflection fiber Bragg\ngratings written uniformly along its length. The fiber's Verdet constant\ndetermines the strength of the Faraday effect which effectuates the measurement\nof local B along the fiber placed intimately next to or within a magnetized\nplasma volume. A robust measurement of the field distribution along the fiber\nis obtained at high rep rates, 5 MHz, high spatial resolution(1-10cm), high B\nfield accuracy(<1%) and temporal response (ns). Multipathing in the BTOF\nproduces 3rd order reflections that contaminate the LIDAR signal. Algorithms\nare given for calculating the level of contamination for uniform and flat\nreflection designs, in particular and any reflection series in general. The\ncontamination is bracketed giving confidence in designing and implementing a\nBTOF. Applications include magnetic fusion devices, rail guns, high temperature\nsuperconducting magnets and magnetized target fusion research."}

By employing this differentiable\napproximation, for the first time, we optimize a finite-beta stellarator to\ndirectly reduce neoclassical ripple transport using reverse-mode\ndifferentiation.

While significant progress has been made on the numerical\nfront, theoretical understanding of turbulence in stellarators is still\nlacking. In particular, due to nonaxisymmetry, different field lines couple\nwithin flux surfaces, the effects from which have yet to be adequately studied.\nIn this work, we numerically simulate the linear electrostatic\nion-temperature-gradient modes in stellarators using the global gyrokinetic\nparticle-in-cell code GTC. We find that the linear eigenmode structures are\nnonuniform across field lines on flux surfaces and are localized at the\ndownstream of the ion diamagnetic drift. Based on a simple model from Zocco et\nal. [Phys. Plasmas 23, 082516 (2016); 27, 022507 (2020)], we show that the\nlocalization can be explained from the nonzero imaginary part of the binormal\nwavenumber. We further demonstrate that a localized surface-global eigenmode\ncan be constructed from local gyrokinetic codes stella and GX, only if we first\nsolve the local dispersion relation with real wavenumbers on each field line,\nand then do an analytic continuation to the complex-wavenumber plane. These\nresults suggest that the complex-wavenumber spectra from surface-global effects\nare required to understand the linear drift-wave eigenmode structures in\nstellarators."}
