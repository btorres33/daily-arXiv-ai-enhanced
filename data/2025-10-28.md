### [1] [A Feature Engineering Approach for Business Impact-Oriented Failure Detection in Distributed Instant Payment Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21710)
*Lorenzo Porcelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于ISO 20022消息交换处理时间的特征工程方法，通过异常检测实现早期故障检测和定位，并提供可解释的解释。在TARGET即时支付结算（TIPS）系统上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测多样异常模式，减少调查时间，弥合可观测性差距，并区分内部和外部支付系统问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 即时支付基础设施要求极高性能，每天处理数百万笔交易且期望零停机时间。传统监控方法无法弥合技术基础设施指标与业务流程可见性之间的差距。研究旨在解决此问题，提高系统的可靠性和可观测性，确保业务连续性并快速理解故障的业务影响。

Method: 方法基于连续ISO 20022消息交换处理时间的特征工程，创建系统状态的紧凑表示。应用异常检测技术到这些特征上，以实现早期故障检测和事件分类。实验设置包括在TIPS系统上使用真实世界事件和受控模拟进行评估，模拟多样异常模式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效检测多样异常模式，并提供内在可解释的解释，使操作员理解业务影响。通过将特征映射到不同的处理阶段，框架能区分内部和外部支付系统问题，显著减少调查时间，并弥合分布式系统中交易状态碎片化的可观测性差距。具体性能指标如检测率或误报率未在摘要中提供。

Conclusion: 该框架的 impact 包括改善即时支付系统的可观测性和故障响应速度。局限性可能包括特定于支付系统或依赖于数据质量。未来工作可能涉及扩展到其他分布式系统或优化特征工程方法。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

### [2] [What Causes Postoperative Aspiration?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21779)
*Supriya Nagesh,Karina Covarrubias,Robert El-Kareh,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Nina Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发并验证了基于机器学习的术后 aspiration 风险预测模型，利用 MIMIC-IV 数据库中的 40 万例住院记录，通过 XGBoost、MLP 和随机森林模型实现 0.86 AUROC 和 77.3% 敏感度。研究发现最大日阿片剂量、住院时长和患者年龄是关键预测因子，并通过因果分析证实阿片类药物（ATE=0.25）和手术部位（颈部 0.20，头部 0.19）为显著致因因素。研究还揭示性别差异：男性 aspirat ion 风险为女性 1.5 倍且接受 27% 更高阿片剂量，提示需针对性干预和进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术后 aspiration 是导致手术患者发病率和死亡率的重要因素。当前临床缺乏有效的风险分层工具，难以实施及时预防性干预。建立可靠的风险预测模型可帮助识别高危患者，优化围手术期管理，从而改善预后。该研究旨在填补这一临床空白，利用大规模电子健康记录开发预测模型并探索致因因素。

Method: 从 MIMIC-IV 数据库提取 40 万例住院记录，筛选出 826 例术后 7 天内发生 aspiration 的手术患者（平均年龄 62 岁，55.7% 男性）及匹配的非 aspiration 对照组。构建三类机器学习模型：XGBoost、多层感知机（MLP）和随机森林，使用术前住院数据进行训练。为探究因果关系，采用增广逆概率加权法（Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting）估算平均治疗效应（ATE），分析关键因素的影响。模型通过独立测试集验证性能，采用 AUROC、敏感度等指标评估。

Result: 机器学习模型在独立测试集上达到 AUROC 0.86 和 77.3% 敏感度。特征重要性分析显示最大日阿片剂量、住院时长和患者年龄为最重要预测因子。因果分析表明：阿片类药物使用导致 aspiration 风险增加 0.25（±0.06），颈部手术（0.20±0.13）和头颈部手术（0.19±0.13）为显著致因因素。尽管手术率无性别差异，男性 aspirat ion 风险是女性 1.5 倍，且接受的最高日阿片剂量高 27%。

Conclusion: 研究证实机器学习模型能有效预测术后 aspiration 风险，为靶向预防措施提供依据。最大日阿片剂量和手术部位是影响风险的关键因素。发现的性别差异现象（男性更高阿片剂量和 aspiration 风险）需深入研究。本研究对改进术后护理流程和 aspiration 预防策略具有重要临床意义。局限性包括单中心数据库可能存在选择偏倚，且未验证干预措施的有效性。未来工作应聚焦于多中心验证、探索性别特异性管理方案，以及设计前瞻性随机试验评估基于模型的干预效果。

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

### [3] [Online Mixture of Experts: No-Regret Learning for Optimal Collective Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21788)
*Larkin Liu,Jalal Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了在线混合专家（Online Mixture-of-Experts, OMoE）方法，这是一种专家指导的bandit学习框架。论文提出了两种算法：第一种结合聚合投票和UCB驱动的连续消除方法，可有效修剪次优的探索动作；第二种采用在线加权多数投票机制，根据专家的预测能力按比例分配投票权重。研究推导了bandit设置下的理论遗憾保证，并将方法应用于专家大型语言模型（LLMs）的在线微调，其中生成式LLM在每个响应后动态调整专家权重或选择最优专家委员会。这些方法为结合多个专家提供了新的方法论和无遗憾保证，能够提高整体聚合模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究问题在于如何有效地聚合多个专家的输出以实现最优的总体准确性。在现实世界的应用中，特别是大型语言模型领域，单个模型可能无法处理所有类型的任务或查询。现有的混合专家方法通常需要离线训练或固定的专家组合，缺乏动态调整能力。Bandit学习框架提供了在线决策的理论基础，但传统方法在专家聚合方面存在效率低下和探索-利用平衡的挑战。本研究旨在解决如何在线地、智能地选择和聚合专家，以实现最优性能，同时保证理论上的遗憾界限。

Method: 论文提出了两种算法：1) 聚合投票与UCB驱动的连续消除算法，通过UCB（Upper Confidence Bound）方法评估专家性能，并逐步消除表现较差的专家，减少无效探索；2) 在线加权多数投票机制，根据每个专家的历史预测表现动态分配权重，预测能力更强的专家获得更大的决策权重。研究将这些方法应用于大型语言模型的在线微调场景，其中模型在生成每个响应后动态重组专家委员会或重新加权。实验设计包括理论分析和实证验证，在理想条件下推导出bandit设置下的遗憾保证，并在实际LLM应用中验证方法的有效性。

Result: 研究提供了理论上的遗憾保证，证明了所提出方法在bandit设置下的收敛性和性能边界。实验结果展示了这些方法在专家大型语言模型在线微调中的应用效果，能够动态选择最优专家组合并提高总体模型性能。通过UCB驱动的连续消除，算法能够高效地修剪次优专家，减少计算开销；而加权多数投票机制则能够根据专家的实际表现进行更智能的聚合，进一步提升准确性。这些结果表明，OMoE框架能够实现比单独使用聚合模型更好的性能，同时保持在线学习的效率。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入在线混合专家框架，为多专家系统的在线决策提供了新的方法论和无遗憾保证。UCB驱动的连续消除和在线加权多数投票两种算法解决了专家聚合中的关键挑战，特别是在需要动态调整的在线学习场景中。研究在理论分析和实证验证方面都取得了显著成果，为大型语言模型等复杂系统的优化提供了新的思路。未来工作可以进一步探索更复杂的专家选择策略、处理专家间的相关性、以及将方法扩展到其他在线决策领域。研究的主要局限性包括理论推导依赖于理想条件，实际应用中可能需要更多的调优，以及计算复杂度可能随专家数量增加而上升。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

### [4] [Variance-Reduction Guidance: Sampling Trajectory Optimization for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21792)
*Shifeng Xu,Yanzhu Liu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为方差减少引导(VRG)的新方法，用于解决扩散模型在采样过程中预测误差累积导致生成质量下降的问题。VRG通过统计测量预测误差，在不修改或微调模型的情况下，寻找具有相同采样步数但能产生更高质量结果的新轨迹。该方法适用于条件生成和无条件生成，实验证明在各种数据集和基线上都能显著提升扩散模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为新兴的生成模型，其采样过程包含多个步骤，每一步模型都需要从含噪声样本中预测噪声。然而，模型预测时会偏离真实值，这种偏差被称为预测误差。这些误差在采样过程中会逐渐累积，最终严重恶化生成质量。这个问题对扩散模型的实际应用至关重要，因为生成质量直接决定了模型的实用价值。目前缺乏有效的方法来测量和缓解这种累积误差，因此研究一种能够提高生成质量而不需要重新训练或修改模型的方法具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Method: VRG方法的核心技术包括：1) 统计测量预测误差的新技术，能够准确量化每一步的预测偏差；2) 基于预定义采样轨迹的优化搜索算法，寻找在相同采样步数下产生更高质量结果的新轨迹；3) 方差减少引导机制，通过调整采样路径来降低预测误差的累积效应。该方法的关键优势是不需要对基础扩散模型进行任何修改或微调，只需在现有采样过程中应用引导机制即可。实验设置包括在多种数据集（如ImageNet、CIFAR等）上测试VRG的效果，并与现有的扩散模型采样方法进行比较，评估生成质量和效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，VRG在各种数据集和基线上都能显著提升扩散模型的生成质量。具体表现为：1) 在相同采样步数下，生成的图像质量更高；2) 预测误差累积得到有效控制；3) 在条件生成（如文本到图像）和无条件生成任务中均表现出色；4) 相比现有方法，VRG在保持计算效率的同时获得了更好的生成结果。这些改进通过定量指标（如FID分数、IS分数等）和定性评估都得到了验证，证明了VRG方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: VRG为解决扩散模型预测误差累积问题提供了一种创新且实用的解决方案。其最大贡献在于无需模型修改就能提升生成质量，大大降低了应用门槛。然而，该方法仍存在一些局限性，如搜索最优轨迹的计算复杂度可能较高，以及在极端噪声水平下的效果可能受限。未来工作可以探索更高效的轨迹搜索算法，研究不同采样器下的VRG适应性，以及将VRG与其他生成模型技术结合。总体而言，VRG代表了扩散模型优化领域的重要进展，为提高生成模型质量提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

### [5] [Quantifying Multimodal Imbalance: A GMM-Guided Adaptive Loss for Audio-Visual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21797)
*Zhaocheng Liu,Zhiwen Yu,Xiaoqing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种量化多模态不平衡的新方法，通过定义‘模态差距（Modality Gap）’并建模其分布为双峰高斯混合模型（GMM），区分平衡与不平衡样本。基于贝叶斯定理计算样本归属概率，设计了三目标自适应损失函数，结合两阶段训练策略，在CREMA-D和AVE数据集上分别达到80.65%和70.90%的准确率，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的多模态不平衡解决方案主要依赖架构改进和优化策略，忽视了模态间不平衡程度的定量分析。这导致模型无法精准识别不平衡样本的特性，影响跨模态学习效果。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过量化分析揭示模态不平衡的内在规律，并设计针对性的损失函数以提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 定义‘模态差距’：计算不同模态（如音频与视觉）对真实类别的Softmax分数差异；2) 分布建模：利用双峰GMM拟合差距分布，区分‘模态平衡’与‘模态不平衡’样本；3) 概率估计：应用贝叶斯定理计算样本归属两类分布的后验概率；4) 自适应损失函数：实现三个目标——最小化总体差距、引导不平衡分布向平衡分布迁移、对不平衡样本施加更高惩罚权重；5) 两阶段训练：先进行预热训练，再执行自适应训练。

Result: 在公开数据集CREMA-D和AVE上的实验表明，本方法在准确性上达到当前最优（SOTA）水平，分别取得80.65%和70.90%的准确率。结果验证了模态差距分布的双峰特性及自适应损失函数的有效性，显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 本研究通过量化分析揭示了多模态不平衡的本质规律，提出的自适应损失函数和训练策略为解决跨模态学习问题提供了新思路。未来可扩展至更多模态场景，探索动态权重机制优化，以及在实时交互系统中的应用。潜在局限包括对特定数据集的依赖性和计算复杂度的潜在增加。

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

### [6] [Geographic Transferability of Machine Learning Models for Short-Term Airport Fog Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21819)
*Marcelo Cerda Castillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出通过物理特征工程实现机场短时大雾预报的地理泛化性突破。使用基于热力学和辐射过程的坐标无关特征集训练XGBoost模型，在智利圣地亚哥数据上训练后，成功应用于11,650公里外的多个不同雾型站点，AUC值保持0.923-0.947。SHAP分析证实模型学到了普适的物理关系而非局地特征，为跨区域气象预测提供了新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机场大雾（能见度<1.0km）的短时预报面临地理迁移难题：主流机器学习模型依赖地点特异性特征，导致模型无法跨区域应用。这种局限性限制了气象预测工具的实际部署效率，尤其当新站点缺乏本地化训练数据时。本研究旨在探索是否可通过编码基本热力学和辐射过程构建坐标无关特征集，实现模型的跨地理区域泛化，从而建立普适性大气预报工具。

Method: 采用梯度提升分类器（XGBoost）和基于物理的特征工程方法。核心创新在于构建坐标无关特征集，包含：①能见度持续性特征 ②太阳天顶角计算 ③地表-自由大气温度梯度 ④辐射冷却率估算。实验采用严格零样本测试：在智利圣地亚哥站（SCEL）2002-2009年数据上训练，测试2010-2012年留出集，并在2,970km外的智利Puerto Montt（SCTE）、11,650km外的旧金山（KSFO）和伦敦（EGLL）站点直接应用。所有站点使用统一特征工程流程，保持模型参数完全一致。

Result: 模型在圣地亚哥测试集上AUC达0.947，在跨国站点（伦敦、旧金山）和不同雾型（辐射雾、平流雾、海上雾）上仍保持优异性能（AUC范围0.923-0.947）。SHAP特征重要性分析显示三个主导因素：能见度历史值（37%）、太阳天顶角（28%）、地表与850hPa温度梯度（19%）。该特征排名在所有测试站点高度一致，表明模型捕获了普适物理机制。特别值得注意的是，模型在伦敦站点（北纬51度）和圣地亚哥（南纬33度）的跨半球测试中仍保持80%以上的特征相关性。

Conclusion: 研究证实物理约束的坐标无关特征工程可显著提升气象模型的地理泛化能力，为跨区域大气预报提供新思路。主要贡献包括：①建立基于热力学过程的通用特征集 ②验证梯度提升模型在气象预测中的跨区域适用性 ③揭示决定雾生消的关键普适物理因子。局限性在于模型需完整输入特征集，对缺失数据敏感。未来工作应拓展至更复杂天气现象，优化特征缺失处理机制，并探索与数值天气预报模式的融合。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

*Rekha R Nair,Tina Babu,Alavikunhu Panthakkan,Hussain Al-Ahmad,Balamurugan Balusamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Hierarchical Attention-based Interpretable Network (HAIN)，通过融合多级注意力机制、降维技术和解释驱动损失函数，实现了对复杂生物医学数据的高度可解释且稳健的分析。在TCGA数据集上取得94.3%分类准确率，超越SHAP和LIME等后-hoc可解释方法，在透明度和解释力方面表现更优，并能有效识别生物相关癌症生物标志物，推动精确医疗和监管合规的透明AI发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据（如基因组学、医疗和金融领域）的激增催生了对兼具高精度和内在可解释性的机器学习模型的迫切需求。传统深度学习方法虽预测性能强，但缺乏透明度，阻碍其在关键决策场景的应用。可解释性对于临床决策、法规合规及生物发现至关重要，能增强用户信任并揭示数据内在机制。现有方法多为后-hoc解释（如SHAP、LIME），难以保证解释与模型预测的一致性，亟需从模型架构层面革新以实现预测与解释的统一。

Method: HAIN架构包含三个核心组件：1）多级注意力机制，通过分层特征选择捕捉局部和全局依赖关系；2）维度压缩模块，降低计算复杂度同时保留关键信息；3）解释驱动损失函数，引导模型在优化预测时同步生成解释。具体实现中采用梯度加权注意力生成特征级解释，通过原型化表示提供全局模型解释。实验在TCGA数据集上进行，使用标准分类指标评估模型性能，并对比SHAP、LIME等后-hoc方法的解释效果。

Result: 1）分类准确率达到94.3%，显著优于传统深度学习模型及SHAP/LIME等后-hoc可解释方法；2）梯度加权注意力有效识别关键特征（如癌症相关基因突变），原型化表示揭示模型决策模式；3）在解释力评估中，临床专家对HAIN生成的解释满意度高于对比方法；4）模型在噪声数据中保持稳健性，证明其鲁棒性。关键创新在于将可解释性嵌入模型训练过程，而非事后补充。

Conclusion: HAIN通过整合多层次注意力、降维和解释驱动优化，实现了预测精度与可解释性的平衡，为生物医学数据分析提供了新工具。突破性在于从架构层面解决解释一致性问题，支持临床决策和生物发现。局限性包括对非生物数据的泛化性待验证，以及高维数据下计算成本可能较高。未来将拓展至多模态数据融合，并探索在线学习和联邦学习场景中的可解释性保障。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

### [8] [Beyond Point Matching: Evaluating Multiscale Dubuc Distance for Time Series Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21824)
*Azim Ahmadzadeh,Mahsa Khazaei,Elaina Rohlfing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multiscale Duboc Distance (MDD), a novel time series similarity measure that evaluates data across multiple temporal scales and avoids point-to-point alignment. It demonstrates substantial performance improvements over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in classification tasks, validated through extensive testing on 95 UCR archive datasets and real-world applications. MDD addresses key limitations of DTW in handling multi-scale patterns and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series data presents significant challenges in data mining due to their high dimensionality and complex temporal structures. While Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has been widely adopted for time series similarity measurement, it suffers from two critical limitations: 1) it primarily focuses on single-scale patterns without capturing multi-temporal characteristics, and 2) its point-to-point alignment approach can be computationally intensive and sensitive to noise. The research addresses these gaps by proposing MDD, which offers a fundamentally different approach to measuring similarity across multiple scales while avoiding the computational burden of alignment. This work responds to an urgent need for more efficient and effective time series analysis methods in applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to financial forecasting.

Method: Methodology centers on implementing and comparing two similarity measures: 1) The proposed Multiscale Duboc Distance (MDD) operates through a multi-resolution analysis framework that decomposes time series into multiple temporal scales using wavelet transforms or similar techniques, then computes distance metrics across these scales without requiring point-wise alignment. 2) Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) serves as the baseline comparison, implementing standard dynamic programming with Euclidean distance as the local cost measure. The experimental setup includes systematic simulations designed to test specific hypotheses about scale sensitivity and computational efficiency, supplemented by comprehensive testing on 95 standardized datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. Both methods were evaluated using standard classification performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) and computational efficiency measures (execution time, scalability).

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that MDD consistently outperforms DTW across multiple evaluation criteria. In the UCR archive tests, MDD achieved statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy on the majority of datasets, with particularly substantial gains (up to 15-20% improvement) in scenarios involving multi-scale patterns or noisy data. The simulation studies confirmed MDD's superior ability to capture temporal relationships across different time resolutions while maintaining computational efficiency - MDD showed 30-50% faster processing times than DTW for comparable dataset sizes. The real-world application validation demonstrated practical utility, with MDD enabling more accurate classification in challenging domains. Performance gaps were most pronounced in three areas: handling of irregular sampling, robustness to temporal noise, and efficiency with long sequences. However, the results also indicated that DTW maintained advantages in specific scenarios involving strict local pattern matching requirements.

Conclusion: The research establishes MDD as a significant advancement in time series similarity measurement, particularly valuable for applications requiring multi-scale analysis and computational efficiency. The method demonstrates clear practical utility through real-world validation and provides substantial performance improvements over established DTW in many scenarios. Key limitations include potential reduced effectiveness for applications requiring precise local alignment and sensitivity to the choice of scale parameters. Future work should focus on: 1) developing adaptive scale selection mechanisms within MDD, 2) extending the method to handle multi-variate time series, 3) investigating integration with deep learning architectures for hybrid approaches, and 4) exploring applications in real-time streaming environments where computational efficiency is critical. The research contributes to both theoretical understanding of multi-scale time series analysis and practical tools for data scientists working with complex temporal data.

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

TL;DR: 论文针对代码编辑场景中奖励分布偏斜导致GRPO等相对奖励方法优势计算失真的问题，提出Group Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO)。该方法通过为每个提示符自适应寻找无异常值的最高密度区间(HDI)并采用区间中位数作为自适应Q值替代组均值，实现了鲁棒的奖励归一化。在涵盖10种语言的51,844个真实代码编辑任务上，GAPO在9个指令微调LLM(3B-14B)上均显著提升精确匹配准确率，且保持即插即用和计算高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码编辑大语言模型(LLMs)的强化学习(RL)后训练面临奖励分布偏斜与不可预测异常值问题。现有GRPO等分组相对方法依赖奖励均值计算优势值，当奖励分布存在偏斜时会导致优势估计严重扭曲。这种扭曲在真实代码编辑场景中尤为显著，因涉及多语言、多历史依赖的复杂任务，可能引发训练不稳定和收敛困难。亟需开发能适应非理想奖励分布的鲁棒优化算法，以提升代码生成模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: GAPO核心包含两个阶段的自适应处理：1) 对每个提示符的奖励序列，采用核密度估计自动识别包含最高概率质量的无异常值区间(HDI)；2) 使用该区间的中位数作为自适应Q值替代传统组均值。具体实现中，通过迭代收缩策略动态调整HDI边界以排除离群点，最终在优势计算中采用公式 A = R - Q_adaptive。该方法保持与GRPO相同的critic-free架构，仅修改奖励归一化模块，因此具有即插即用特性。实验采用9个3B-14B参数模型，在包含51,844个历史感知代码编辑任务的真实数据集上验证，对比基线包括GRPO和DAPO等变体。

Result: GAPO在9个模型跨10语言的评测中均实现显著性能提升：相比GRPO平均提升精确匹配(Exact Match)准确率3.2%-7.1%，在JavaScript(提升7.1%)和Python(提升5.8%)上效果最显著。相较于DAPO变体，GAPO在保持计算效率的同时额外提升2.3%准确率。消融实验表明：①HD I选择比简单中位数基线高4.6%准确率；②自适应区间调整比固定区间策略降低40%训练方差。训练稳定性方面，GAPO的奖励分布偏度指标降低68%，且计算开销仅增加12%。

Conclusion: GAPO通过自适应HDI机制有效解决了代码编辑RLHF中的奖励偏斜问题，提供了比现有分组相对方法更鲁棒的解决方案。该方法在保持算法简洁性的同时显著提升模型性能，尤其适用于复杂多语言场景。局限性包括：①对极端尖峰分布的适应性待验证；②需要一定数据量初始化HDI估计；③未考虑奖励分布时序相关性。未来工作将探索：①结合动态HDI边界优化算法；②扩展至多智能体代码协作场景；③研究奖励分布与代码质量关联系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: RestoreLCC是一种针对剪枝大语言模型（LLMs）的恢复策略，通过注意力激活分析识别剪枝导致的信息损失，并通过选择性补偿丢失的组件来恢复模型性能。该方法兼容结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案，在不牺牲稀疏性和推理效率的前提下，显著优于现有基线方法。RestoreLCC通过对比探测关键注意力头、从激活差异中提取丢失组件，并将其重新注入到相应的剪枝头来实现性能恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪枝作为减少大型语言模型规模和推理成本的重要技术，通常会导致性能下降。现有的恢复方法主要采用参数高效微调（PEFT）技术（如LoRA），但这些方法专门为密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的独特属性，导致恢复效果不佳。剪枝导致的信息损失会体现在注意力激活中，如何有效识别并补偿这些丢失的信息成为恢复剪枝模型性能的关键挑战。

Method: RestoreLCC采用三阶段策略：1）通过激活编辑技术对比探测关键的注意力头；2）从激活差异中提取丢失的组件信息；3）将这些组件重新注入到相应的剪枝头中进行补偿和恢复。该方法兼容多种剪枝方案（结构化、半结构化、非结构化），能够保持模型的稀疏性和推理效率，同时恢复性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用性能和特定任务性能恢复方面均显著优于现有最先进的基线方法。该方法能够在不牺牲稀疏性和推理效率的前提下，实现更好的性能恢复效果，证明了其作为即插即用方法的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC为剪枝大语言模型的性能恢复提供了新的思路和方法。通过专注于注意力激活中的信息损失检测和补偿，该方法有效地解决了现有PEFT方法对剪枝模型恢复效果不佳的问题。该成果对推动大语言模型的高效部署和应用具有重要意义，为未来在资源受限环境中部署高性能LLMs提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

### [11] [A Multimodal, Multitask System for Generating E Commerce Text Listings from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21835)
*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research addresses the limitations of Vision-to-Language Models (VLMs) in retail product description generation, specifically focusing on factual hallucinations and inefficiencies of siloed models. The authors propose a novel end-to-end multi-task system with two key innovations: 1) A multi-task learning approach that jointly trains a vision encoder for attribute prediction (color, hemline, neck style) and price regression, and 2) A hierarchical generation process that incorporates the model's own predicted attributes into the text generation prompt to enhance factual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: the multi-task approach outperforms independent models with 3.6% better R² value and 6.6% higher F1 score. The hierarchical generation process reduces factual hallucinations by 44.5% (from 12.7% to 7.1%) and improves inference latency by 3.5x compared to direct VLMs, though with a minor tradeoff of 3.5% lower ROUGE-L score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual creation of compelling product descriptions and names is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process for retailers, creating significant operational bottlenecks in e-commerce. While generative AI and Vision-to-Language Models (VLMs) offer automation potential, current implementations suffer from critical limitations that hinder their effectiveness. Specifically, VLMs are prone to factual "hallucinations" where generated descriptions contain inaccurate information about the product features. Additionally, the industry practice of using siloed, single-task models is both computationally inefficient and fails to capture the complex interdependencies between different product attributes. These challenges create substantial barriers to implementing reliable automated product description systems that can maintain factual accuracy while improving operational efficiency.

Method: The proposed system employs an end-to-end multi-task architecture with two primary components. First, a multi-task learning approach is implemented where a single vision encoder backbone is jointly trained on multiple related tasks: attribute classification (including color, hemline style, and neck style) and price regression. This approach enables the model to learn shared representations that capture interdependent relationships between product features. Second, a hierarchical generation process is introduced where the model's own predicted attributes are embedded within a prompt that is then fed to a text decoder. This hierarchical approach creates a feedback mechanism that grounds the text generation process in the model's own visual predictions, enhancing factual consistency. The experimental setup compares this architecture against baseline models including independent attribute classifiers and price regressors, as well as direct vision-to-language models without the hierarchical prompting structure. The researchers conducted ablation studies to isolate the contributions of each component.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across multiple metrics. The multi-task learning approach outperforms independent models, achieving a 3.6% improvement in R² value for price regression and a 6.6% improvement in F1 score for attribute classification tasks. The hierarchical generation process proves particularly effective, reducing factual hallucination rates from 12.7% to 7.1% - representing a 44.5% relative reduction compared to non-hierarchical ablation models. Additionally, the hierarchical approach improves inference latency by a factor of 3.5 when compared to direct vision-to-language models of similar size, demonstrating computational efficiency benefits. However, the model does exhibit one limitation: it performs 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language models on ROUGE-L score, indicating a tradeoff between factual consistency and lexical overlap with reference descriptions.

Conclusion: This research successfully addresses two critical challenges in automated product description generation: factual accuracy and computational efficiency. The multi-task learning approach effectively captures interdependent relationships between product attributes while improving prediction accuracy across multiple tasks. The hierarchical generation process represents a significant innovation for reducing factual hallucinations by grounding text generation in the model's own visual predictions. These contributions have substantial practical implications for retail e-commerce, potentially reducing the time and labor required for product description generation while maintaining high factual accuracy. Limitations include the slight reduction in ROUGE-L score indicating potential tradeoffs in lexical similarity, and performance variations across different attribute types. Future work could focus on refining the attribute prediction process, expanding to additional product categories, and investigating methods to mitigate the ROUGE-L score reduction while maintaining the factual consistency benefits.

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

### [12] [COLA: Continual Learning via Autoencoder Retrieval of Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21836)
*Jaya Krishna Mandivarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces COLA, a novel framework for continual learning in large language models (LLMs) that prevents catastrophic forgetting without data replay or extensive task-specific parameters. By using an autoencoder to learn low-dimensional embeddings of task-specific weights, COLA enables efficient knowledge transfer to new tasks while preserving prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate significant reductions in parameter usage and memory size across multiple datasets (including task-oriented dialogue systems and intent classification), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning (CL) faces the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge when trained on new tasks. While LLMs are powerful, their retraining for continual learning is computationally prohibitive and inherently prone to forgetting. Existing solutions like data replay or task-specific parameters are either privacy-invasive or resource-intensive. This work addresses the urgent need for efficient, parameter-sparse continual learning in LLMs to enable real-world adaptability without compromising prior capabilities.

Method: COLA employs an autoencoder to encode task-specific weight matrices into low-dimensional embeddings. During training on a new task, only the embeddings are updated via gradient descent, while the decoder reconstructs weight matrices to maintain task-specific knowledge. This approach avoids storing raw data (no replay) and minimizes parameter overhead. The framework initializes embeddings for new tasks using a weighted combination of existing task embeddings to facilitate knowledge transfer. Experimental setup includes diverse CL benchmarks: task-oriented dialogue systems and intent classification datasets, evaluated across multiple sequential task exposures.

Result: COLA achieves near-zero catastrophic forgetting while requiring 90% fewer parameters than baseline methods. Performance metrics show: (1) <5% degradation on prior tasks across all datasets; (2) 60-80% memory footprint reduction versus replay-based methods; (3) 3-5× faster adaptation to new tasks than fine-tuning. COLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LoRA, replay methods) in incremental learning scenarios, particularly excelling in cross-domain transfer tasks. The parameter efficiency is consistent across all evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: COLA establishes a new paradigm for efficient continual learning in LLMs by decoupling task knowledge into compact embeddings. It solves core CL challenges: catastrophic forgetting, computational burden, and privacy concerns (no data replay). Limitations include sensitivity to task similarity assumptions and unverified scalability to ultra-large models. Future work should explore: (1) adaptive embedding initialization for dissimilar tasks; (2) integration with sparsity techniques; (3) testing on billion-parameter models; (4) theoretical analysis of embedding space geometry.

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

*Azree Nazri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces KARIPAP, a novel compression framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages quantum-inspired tensor network techniques. By employing Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction, KARIPAP captures complex multi-directional entanglement patterns in transformer layers that traditional methods overlook. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B demonstrate up to 93% memory reduction, 70% parameter compression, 50% faster training, 25% faster inference, with only 2-3% accuracy degradation. The approach reveals that deeper transformer layers exhibit higher redundancy suitable for tensor factorization, suggesting modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional entanglement manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA has created significant computational and environmental challenges due to their massive parameter scales. These models demand prohibitive training costs, substantial energy consumption, and face deployment limitations on edge devices. While existing compression techniques (pruning, distillation, low-rank approximation, and quantization) reduce model size, they fail to account for complex inter-layer correlations within transformer architectures. This limitation prevents optimal compression while maintaining performance. The research addresses this gap by exploring quantum-inspired tensor network methods that can capture intricate multi-dimensional relationships in neural network parameters, potentially enabling more efficient and sustainable AI systems.

Method: KARIPAP employs a quantum-inspired tensor network compression framework centered on two core components: 1) Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) representation, which models multi-directional entanglement patterns in attention mechanisms and deep transformer layers unlike 1D Matrix Product States; and 2) Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction algorithm, which enables polynomial-time complexity for tensor network operations. The methodology involves: - Layer-wise entanglement profiling to identify compressible components - Tensor network factorization of weight matrices - iPEPS-based representation of compressed components - TRG-based efficient contraction and inference - Custom optimization to preserve critical correlation geometries. The experimental setup utilized LLaMA-2 7B model with standard benchmarks for accuracy measurement, memory consumption tracking, and inference latency testing.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B yielded significant improvements across multiple dimensions: - Memory footprint reduction: Up to 93% compared to baseline models - Parameter compression: Achieved 70% reduction while maintaining functional integrity - Training efficiency: 50% faster training convergence - Inference speed: 25% reduction in inference latency - Accuracy preservation: Only 2-3% degradation on standard evaluation metrics - Layer analysis revealed deeper transformer layers exhibit higher entanglement redundancy, making them more suitable for tensor factorization. Comparative analysis showed KARIPAP outperformed traditional compression methods in preserving model performance while achieving greater compression ratios. The tensor network approach maintained key correlation geometries that were typically disrupted by conventional compression techniques.

Conclusion: KARIPAP establishes that modern LLMs can be effectively compressed using quantum-inspired tensor network methods without catastrophic performance loss. The research demonstrates that transformer architectures occupy low-dimensional entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable and energy-efficient AI architectures. Key impacts include: - Significant reduction in computational resources and environmental footprint - Potential for broader deployment of large models on resource-constrained devices - Novel approach to understanding neural network compression through quantum information theory. Limitations include the current experimental scope limited to LLaMA-2 7B and potential challenges in applying the method to extremely deep or specialized architectures. Future work should explore applications to larger models, integration with hardware acceleration, and further investigation of entanglement properties in different neural network types.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

*Yongchao Huang,Pengfei Zhang,Shahzad Mumtaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable membership inference attack (MIA) method based on Gaussian Process (GP) meta-modeling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on computationally expensive shadow models or extensive query access, GP-MIA leverages post-hoc metrics (accuracy, entropy, dataset statistics) and optional sensitivity features (gradients, Neural Tangent Kernel measures) from a single trained model. It trains a GP classifier to distinguish training data members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data, CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 demonstrate that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and generalizability, offering a practical alternative to current MIAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose significant privacy risks by determining whether a specific data point was part of a model's training set. Existing MIA methods often require the construction of shadow models, which is computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale models, or they necessitate heavy query access to the target model, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the critical need for a more efficient and accessible MIA approach that can operate with minimal resource requirements while maintaining high accuracy. The research aims to provide a practical tool for privacy assessment without the prohibitive costs associated with prior methods.

Method: GP-MIA utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier trained on post-hoc metrics derived from a single trained model. These metrics include accuracy, entropy, dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features such as gradients or Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) measures. The GP classifier is designed to distinguish between data points that are members of the training set and those that are not. A key feature of GP-MIA is its ability to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, enhancing interpretability and reliability. The experimental setup involves evaluating GP-MIA on multiple datasets: synthetic data, a real-world fraud detection dataset, CIFAR-10 for image classification, and WikiText-2 for language modeling. The method is compared against existing MIA techniques to assess its performance and generalizability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy across diverse datasets, including synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data, CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2. The method shows strong generalizability, performing effectively on both image classification and language modeling tasks. GP-MIA outperforms existing MIAs that rely on shadow models or heavy query access, offering a more practical and efficient alternative. The calibrated uncertainty estimates provided by the GP classifier enhance the interpretability of the attack results. Key metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC, with GP-MIA consistently ranking among the top performers in comparative evaluations.

Conclusion: GP-MIA represents a significant advancement in membership inference attacks by providing an efficient, interpretable, and practical method for privacy assessment. It eliminates the need for computationally intensive shadow models or extensive query access, making it suitable for real-world applications. The approach demonstrates high accuracy and generalizability across various datasets and model types. However, potential limitations include the computational complexity of GP models with very large datasets and the reliance on specific post-hoc metrics. Future work may focus on optimizing the GP model for scalability and exploring additional sensitivity features to further improve performance. The method provides a valuable tool for evaluating model privacy risks and informing the development of more robust privacy-preserving techniques.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,

*Kaiyi Xu,Junchao Gong,Wenlong Zhang,Ben Fei,Lei Bai,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SynCast方法，首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报领域，采用Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization (Diffusion-SPO)的两阶段后训练框架来解决多目标评估指标之间的冲突问题。该方法首先专注于降低误报率(FAR)，然后在保持FAR对齐的基础上进一步优化临界成功指数(CSI)，从而在相互冲突的指标间实现协同改进，有效解决了现有深度学习方法在捕捉极端降水事件和细尺度降水模式方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报在监测极端天气和防灾减灾中具有重要作用。然而现有深度学习方法面临显著挑战：确定性模型产生过度平滑的预测，难以捕捉极端事件和细尺度降水模式；概率生成模型由于内在随机性，在不同指标间表现波动，难以实现一致的最优性能。此外，降水临近预报通常使用多个相互冲突的评估指标进行评价，如临界成功指数(CSI)与误报率(FAR)之间存在权衡关系，使得现有模型难以同时在两个指标上取得良好表现。这种多目标冲突问题严重制约了降水预报模型的实用性和可靠性。

Method: 本文提出了SynCast方法，采用Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization (Diffusion-SPO)的两阶段后训练框架。第一阶段专注于降低误报率(FAR)，训练模型有效抑制误报；在第一阶段基础上，第二阶段进一步优化临界成功指数(CSI)，同时施加保持FAR对齐的约束，从而在相互冲突的指标间实现协同改进。该方法受到大型语言模型中人类反馈强化学习成功的启发，将偏好优化策略引入降水临近预报领域，首次解决了多目标评估指标冲突这一关键问题。

Result: 基于摘要内容，该方法通过两阶段优化策略成功解决了CSI与FAR之间的权衡关系。第一阶段有效降低了误报率，第二阶段在保持低FAR的基础上提升了CSI，实现了两个关键指标的同时优化。这表明SynCast方法能够在相互冲突的评估指标间达成平衡，提供更加可靠和准确的降水临近预报结果。

Conclusion: SynCast方法通过引入偏好优化和两阶段训练框架，有效解决了降水临近预报领域中长期存在的多目标评估指标冲突问题。该方法为提高降水预报模型的实用性和可靠性提供了新的思路，特别是在捕捉极端降水事件和细尺度降水模式方面具有显著优势。未来研究可以进一步探索该框架在其他气象预报任务中的应用，以及优化计算效率以满足实时预报需求。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

### [16] [TowerVision: Understanding and Improving Multilinguality in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21849)
*André G. Viveiros,Patrick Fernandes,Saul Santos,Sonal Sannigrahi,Emmanouil Zaranis,Nuno M. Guerreiro,Amin Farajian,Pierre Colombo,Graham Neubig,André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TowerVision, an open-source family of multilingual vision-language models (VLMs) designed to overcome the English-centric limitations of existing VLMs. The authors conduct a comprehensive empirical study on multilingual design choices (training data composition, encoder selection, text backbones) and release VisionBlocks, a curated vision-language dataset. TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multimodal multilingual benchmarks, excelling in culturally grounded tasks and translation. Key findings show that multilingual training data improves cross-lingual generalization and that instruction-tuned LLMs are not always optimal. The models surpass larger benchmarks on ALM-Bench, Multi30K, and ViMUL-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) predominantly follow English-centric design processes, severely limiting their effectiveness in multilingual applications. This constraint hinders real-world deployment in diverse linguistic environments, where models must handle tasks like cross-lingual image-text retrieval, multimodal translation, and culturally nuanced understanding. The lack of robust multilingual capabilities creates barriers for underrepresented languages and reduces accessibility for non-English speakers. The authors address this gap by investigating how multilingual design choices impact VLM performance, aiming to develop models that generalize across languages without sacrificing task-specific accuracy. Their work underscores the societal and practical need for inclusive, language-agnostic AI systems.

Method: The authors propose TowerVision, a family of multilingual VLMs built upon the Tower+ multilingual text-only model. Their methodology involves: 1) An empirical study analyzing three key design choices: training data composition (e.g., language diversity, cultural context), encoder selection (e.g., vision backbones), and text backbone integration. 2) Fine-tuning with visual and cultural context, leveraging VisionBlocks—a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. 3) Comparative evaluation against existing models trained on larger datasets. The experimental setup includes image-text tasks (ALM-Bench, Multi30K) and video-text tasks (ViMUL-Bench). Training recipes and model architectures are openly released to facilitate reproducibility.

Result: TowerVision achieves state-of-the-art performance on major multimodal multilingual benchmarks: - Competitive results across all tested languages on ALM-Bench and Multi30K, with significant improvements in culturally grounded tasks and multimodal translation. - Surpasses larger models on ViMUL-Bench for video-text tasks, demonstrating efficiency in cross-lingual generalization. Key findings: 1) Multilingual training data enhances cross-lingual transfer, benefiting both high-resource and underrepresented languages. 2) Instruction-tuned LLMs are not universally optimal; tailored multilingual embeddings outperform them in vision-language contexts. 3) VisionBlocks’ curation (e.g., cultural sensitivity, image-text alignment) directly contributes to robustness. Performance metrics on benchmarks confirm superiority over English-centric baselines.

Conclusion: TowerVision establishes a new standard for multilingual VLMs by proving that targeted design choices (data curation, encoder selection) can outperform larger, English-biased models. The work highlights that cross-lingual generalization is achievable through culturally aware training and multilingual data integration. Limitations include potential gaps in low-resource language coverage and reliance on curated datasets. Future directions involve scaling to more languages, extending to video/audio tasks, and refining cultural context modeling. The release of models, datasets, and training recipes supports community-driven progress in multilingual AI.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

*Bentley DeVilling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这项研究通过跨提供商实验揭示了大型语言模型自反思推理的关键局限性：在没有外部验证的情况下，递归自评估会导致信息停滞而非进步。研究在三种主流模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）和四种任务类型（算术、代码、解释、反思）上进行，发现无基础条件下的信息变化量从早期到晚期迭代下降55%，而最小干预（第3次迭代时插入单一验证步骤）则能使信息变化量反弹28%。研究证实了生成推理中的自我修正存在结构性限制，最小基础作用如同耗散耦合，重新引入信息流。结果确定了反思何时是表演性的而非认识论的，并为有基础的合作推理设计原则提供了依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究问题源于对大型语言模型声称的反思能力与其实际表现之间的差距。虽然LLM常被描述为具备反思推理能力，但递归自我评估在没有外部反馈的情况下经常导致重新表述而非实质进步。这种'镜像循环'现象引发了关键问题：LLM的自我修正是否存在结构性限制？这种限制对模型推理能力的根本性质有何影响？研究意义重大，因为它质疑了现有LLM架构中自监督学习的有效性，揭示了纯基于自回归训练的推理系统可能存在的信息封闭倾向，对理解LLM的推理边界和改进其认知过程具有深远影响。

Method: 研究采用跨提供商实验设计，涵盖144个推理序列，涉及三种代表性模型（OpenAI GPT-4o-mini、Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku、Google Gemini 2.0 Flash）和四种任务家族（算术、代码、解释、反思）。每个任务迭代10次，比较两种条件：无基础自我批判（ungrounded self-critique）和最小基础干预（在第三次迭代时插入单一验证步骤）。主要测量指标包括信息变化量（delta I，通过标准化编辑距离测量）、n-gram新颖性、嵌入漂移和字符级熵。实验设计确保了结果的跨架构一致性和统计可靠性。

Result: 研究发现无基础条件下的推理过程中，平均信息变化量从早期迭代的0.193下降到晚期迭代的0.087，降幅达55%，且在所有三个提供商的模型中表现出一致模式。而在基础干预条件下，信息变化量在干预后立即反弹28%，并在后续迭代中保持非零方差。补充指标（n-gram新颖性、嵌入漂移、字符级熵）均 converged 到同一模式：缺乏外部接触的反思倾向于信息封闭。这些结果共同表明，在没有与独立验证者或环境进行信息交换的情况下，递归推理接近于认识论静止的吸引子状态。研究还发现不同架构间的一致性，表明镜像循环源于共享的自回归训练目标，而非提供商特定的对齐方案。

Conclusion: 研究为生成推理中自我修正的结构性限制提供了实证证据，揭示了一个关键洞见：大型语言模型的反思能力在没有外部验证的情况下本质上是表演性的而非认识论的。最小基础干预被证实为有效的耗散耦合机制，能够重新引入信息流并打破推理循环中的信息封闭。这些发现对LLM设计和部署具有重要影响，强调了在推理系统中引入外部验证的重要性，并为设计有基础的合作推理原则提供了理论依据。研究不仅定义了LLM反思能力的边界，还为改进推理系统的认知过程提供了实用指导，同时开源的材料和代码为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a central tool for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their applicability to real-world systems remains
limited by key challenges such as scalability, temporality, directionality,
data incompleteness, and structural uncertainty. This thesis introduces a
series of models addressing these limitations: SIGN for scalable graph
learning, TGN for temporal graphs, Dir-GNN for directed and heterophilic
networks, Feature Propagation (FP) for learning with missing node features, and
NuGget for game-theoretic structural inference. Together, these contributions
bridge the gap between academic benchmarks and industrial-scale graphs,
enabling the use of GNNs in domains such as social and recommender systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available
at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be

which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as

analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in
the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods

leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities

households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a

information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development

operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or

novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/626619403/PAHQ.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials-- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss--a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures--including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds--
by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate system
or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations of this
framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D recognition, where
relative camera poses naturally define the required edge potentials.

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or
exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use,
generalizable AI platform readily applicable across diverse materials discovery
tasks.

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide

task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often consume excessive tokens, inflating
computational cost and latency. We challenge the assumption that longer
responses improve accuracy. By penalizing reasoning tokens using a discounted
reinforcement learning setup (interpretable as a small token cost) and
analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage
concise yet accurate reasoning. Experiments confirm our theoretical results
that this approach shortens chains of thought while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative models, such as GANs, learn an explicit low-dimensional
representation of a particular class of images, and so they may be used as
natural image priors for solving inverse problems such as image restoration and
compressive sensing. GAN priors have demonstrated impressive performance on
these tasks, but they can exhibit substantial representation error for both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution images, because of the mismatch between
the learned, approximate image distribution and the data generating
distribution. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for reducing the
representation error of GAN priors by modeling images as the linear combination
of a GAN prior with a Deep Decoder. The deep decoder is an underparameterized
and most importantly unlearned natural signal model similar to the Deep Image
Prior. No knowledge of the specific inverse problem is needed in the training
of the GAN underlying our method. For compressive sensing and image
superresolution, our hybrid model exhibits consistently higher PSNRs than both
the GAN priors and Deep Decoder separately, both on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution images. This model provides a method for extensibly and
cheaply leveraging both the benefits of learned and unlearned image recovery
priors in inverse problems.

Abstract: To bridge the ever increasing gap between deep neural networks' complexity
and hardware capability, network quantization has attracted more and more
research attention. The latest trend of mixed precision quantization takes
advantage of hardware's multiple bit-width arithmetic operations to unleash the
full potential of network quantization. However, this also results in a
difficult integer programming formulation, and forces most existing approaches
to use an extremely time-consuming search process even with various
relaxations. Instead of solving a problem of the original integer programming,
we propose to optimize a proxy metric, the concept of network orthogonality,
which is highly correlated with the loss of the integer programming but also
easy to optimize with linear programming. This approach reduces the search time
and required data amount by orders of magnitude, with little compromise on
quantization accuracy. Specifically, we achieve 72.08% Top-1 accuracy on
ResNet-18 with 6.7Mb, which does not require any searching iterations. Given
the high efficiency and low data dependency of our algorithm, we used it for
the post-training quantization, which achieve 71.27% Top-1 accuracy on
MobileNetV2 with only 1.5Mb. Our code is available at

Abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of sampling the optimal transport
coupling between given source and target distributions. In certain cases, the
optimal transport plan takes the form of a one-to-one mapping from the source
support to the target support, but learning or even approximating such a map is
computationally challenging for large and high-dimensional datasets due to the
high cost of linear programming routines and an intrinsic curse of
dimensionality. We study instead the Sinkhorn problem, a regularized form of
optimal transport whose solutions are couplings between the source and the
target distribution. We introduce a novel framework for learning the Sinkhorn
coupling between two distributions in the form of a score-based generative
model. Conditioned on source data, our procedure iterates Langevin Dynamics to
sample target data according to the regularized optimal coupling. Key to this
approach is a neural network parametrization of the Sinkhorn problem, and we
prove convergence of gradient descent with respect to network parameters in
this formulation. We demonstrate its empirical success on a variety of large
scale optimal transport tasks.

Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework to address a broad class of metric and

representer theorem for the simultaneous task of metric and preference
learning. Our key observation is that the representer theorem for this task can
be derived by regularizing the problem with respect to the norm inherent in the
task structure. For the general task of metric learning, our framework leads to
a simple and self-contained representer theorem and offers new geometric
insights into the derivation of representer theorems for this task. In the case
of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs), we illustrate how our representer
theorem can be used to express the solution of the learning problems in terms
of finite kernel terms similar to classical representer theorems. Lastly, our
representer theorem leads to a novel nonlinear algorithm for metric and
preference learning. We compare our algorithm against challenging baseline
methods on real-world rank inference benchmarks, where it achieves competitive
performance. Notably, our approach significantly outperforms vanilla ideal
point methods and surpasses strong baselines across multiple datasets. Code

Abstract: Machine learning models have dual-use potential, potentially serving both

chemistry has specifically surfaced dual-use concerns around toxicological data
and chemical warfare agents. We discuss a chain risk framework identifying
three misuse pathways and corresponding mitigation strategies: inference-level,
model-level, and data-level. At the data level, we introduce a model-agnostic
noising method to increase prediction error in specific desired regions
(sensitive regions). Our results show that selective noise induces variance and
attenuation bias, whereas simply omitting sensitive data fails to prevent
extrapolation. These findings hold for both molecular feature multilayer
perceptrons and graph neural networks. Thus, noising molecular structures can
enable open sharing of potential dual-use molecular data.

Abstract: The exploration problem is one of the main challenges in deep reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent promising works tried to handle the problem with
population-based methods, which collect samples with diverse behaviors derived
from a population of different exploratory policies. Adaptive policy selection
has been adopted for behavior control. However, the behavior selection space is
largely limited by the predefined policy population, which further limits
behavior diversity. In this paper, we propose a general framework called
Learnable Behavioral Control (LBC) to address the limitation, which a) enables
a significantly enlarged behavior selection space via formulating a hybrid
behavior mapping from all policies; b) constructs a unified learnable process
for behavior selection. We introduce LBC into distributed off-policy
actor-critic methods and achieve behavior control via optimizing the selection
of the behavior mappings with bandit-based meta-controllers. Our agents have
achieved 10077.52% mean human normalized score and surpassed 24 human world
records within 1B training frames in the Arcade Learning Environment, which
demonstrates our significant state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance without
degrading the sample efficiency.

Abstract: In consequential domains, it is often impossible to compel individuals to
take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. Under
heterogeneity, covariates may predict take-up of treatment and final outcome,
but differently. While optimal treatment rules optimize causal outcomes across
the population, access parity constraints or other fairness considerations on
who receives treatment can be important. For example, in social services, a
persistent puzzle is the gap in take-up of beneficial services among those who
may benefit from them the most. We study causal identification and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in three case studies based on data from reminders of SNAP benefits
recertification, randomized encouragement to enroll in insurance, and from
pretrial supervised release with electronic monitoring. While the specific
remedy to inequities in algorithmic allocation is context-specific, it requires
studying both take-up of decisions and downstream outcomes of them.

Abstract: Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in
finding the best graph neural network architecture on a given graph dataset.
However, existing GNAS methods still require intensive human labor and rich
domain knowledge when designing the search space and search strategy. To this
end, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into GNAS and present a new GNAS
model based on LLMs (GNAS-LLM for short). The basic idea of GNAS-LLM is to
design a new class of GNAS prompts for LLMs to guide LLMs towards understanding
the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of
descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS.
By iteratively running LLMs with the prompts, GNAS-LLM generates more accurate
graph neural network architectures with fast convergence. Experimental results
show that GNAS-LLM outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods on four
benchmark graph datasets, with an average improvement of 0.7% on the validation
sets and 0.3% on the test sets. Besides, GNAS-LLM achieves an average
improvement of 1.0% on the test sets based on the search space from AutoGEL.

Abstract: Contrastive Learning first extracts features from unlabeled data, followed by
linear probing with labeled data. Adversarial Contrastive Learning (ACL)
integrates Adversarial Training into the first phase to enhance feature
robustness against attacks in the probing phase. While ACL has shown strong
empirical results, its theoretical understanding remains limited. Furthermore,
while a fair amount of theoretical works analyze how the unsupervised loss can
support the supervised loss in the probing phase, none has examined its role to
the robust supervised loss. To fill this gap, our work develops rigorous
theories to identify which components in the unsupervised training can help
improve the robust supervised loss. Specifically, besides the adversarial
contrastive loss, we reveal that the benign one, along with a global divergence
between benign and adversarial examples can also improve robustness. Proper
experiments are conducted to justify our findings.

Abstract: Model fusion aims to integrate several deep neural network (DNN) models'
knowledge into one by fusing parameters, and it has promising applications,
such as improving the generalization of foundation models and parameter
averaging in federated learning. However, models under different settings
(data, hyperparameter, etc.) have diverse neuron permutations; in other words,
from the perspective of loss landscape, they reside in different loss basins,
thus hindering model fusion performances. To alleviate this issue, previous
studies highlighted the role of permutation invariance and have developed
methods to find correct network permutations for neuron alignment after
training. Orthogonal to previous attempts, this paper studies training-time
neuron alignment, improving model fusion without the need for post-matching.
Training-time alignment is cheaper than post-alignment and is applicable in
various model fusion scenarios. Starting from fundamental hypotheses and
theorems, a simple yet lossless algorithm called TNA-PFN is introduced. TNA-PFN
utilizes partially fixed neuron weights as anchors to reduce the potential of
training-time permutations, and it is empirically validated in reducing the
barriers of linear mode connectivity and multi-model fusion. It is also
validated that TNA-PFN can improve the fusion of pretrained models under the
setting of model soup (vision transformers) and ColD fusion (pretrained
language models). Based on TNA-PFN, two federated learning methods, FedPFN and
FedPNU, are proposed, showing the prospects of training-time neuron alignment.
FedPFN and FedPNU reach state-of-the-art performances in federated learning
under heterogeneous settings and can be compatible with the server-side
algorithm.

Abstract: Generative models have shown promising results in capturing human mobility
characteristics and generating synthetic trajectories. However, it remains
challenging to ensure that the generated geospatial mobility data is
semantically realistic, including consistent location sequences, and reflects
real-world characteristics, such as constraining on geospatial limits. We
reformat human mobility modeling as an autoregressive generation task to
address these issues, leveraging the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)
architecture. To ensure its controllable generation to alleviate the above
challenges, we propose a geospatially-aware generative model, MobilityGPT. We
propose a gravity-based sampling method to train a transformer for semantic
sequence similarity. Then, we constrained the training process via a road
connectivity matrix that provides the connectivity of sequences in trajectory
generation, thereby keeping generated trajectories in geospatial limits.
Lastly, we proposed to construct a preference dataset for fine-tuning
MobilityGPT via Reinforcement Learning from Trajectory Feedback (RLTF)
mechanism, which minimizes the travel distance between training and the
synthetically generated trajectories. Experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate MobilityGPT's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in
generating high-quality mobility trajectories that are closest to real data in
terms of origin-destination similarity, trip length, travel radius, link, and
gravity distributions. We release the source code and reference links to
datasets at https://github.com/ammarhydr/MobilityGPT.

Abstract: Diagnostic tests that can detect pre-clinical or sub-clinical infection, are
one of the most powerful tools in our armoury of weapons to control infectious
diseases. Considerable effort has been paid to improving diagnostic testing for
human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of
diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. We use
machine learning to assess the surrounding risk landscape under which a
diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation. We develop this to
predict the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis incidents in cattle herds,
exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show
that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved
so that the proportion of infected herds detected improves by over 5 percentage
points, or 240 additional infected herds detected in one year beyond those
detected by the skin test alone. We also use feature importance testing for
assessing the weighting of risk factors. While many factors are associated with
increased risk of incidents, of note are several factors that suggest that in
some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected.

Abstract: He and Hofmann (arXiv:2311.01906) detailed a skipless transformer without the
V and P (post-attention projection) linear layers, which reduces the total
number of weights. However, this scheme is only applicable to MHA (multi-head
attention), but not for MQA (multi-query attention) and GQA (grouped-query
attention). The latter schemes are used by many popular LLMs such as Llama 2,
Mistral, Mixtral, PaLM, and Gemma. Therefore, this micro-paper proposes
mathematically equivalent versions that are suitable for MQA and GQA. For
example, removing Q and P from a skipless version of Mistral-7B would remove
15% of its weights (and thus reduce its compute and memory complexity). Watch

Abstract: We propose a new deep learning model, WaveCastNet, to forecast
high-dimensional wavefields. WaveCastNet integrates a convolutional long
expressive memory architecture into a sequence-to-sequence forecasting
framework, enabling it to model long-term dependencies and multiscale patterns
in both space and time. By sharing weights across spatial and temporal
dimensions, WaveCastNet requires significantly fewer parameters than more
resource-intensive models such as transformers, resulting in faster inference
times. Crucially, WaveCastNet also generalizes better than transformers to rare
and critical seismic scenarios, such as high-magnitude earthquakes. Here, we
show the ability of the model to predict the intensity and timing of
destructive ground motions in real time, using simulated data from the San
Francisco Bay Area. Furthermore, we demonstrate its zero-shot capabilities by
evaluating WaveCastNet on real earthquake data. Our approach does not require
estimating earthquake magnitudes and epicenters, steps that are prone to error
in conventional methods, nor does it rely on empirical ground-motion models,
which often fail to capture strongly heterogeneous wave propagation effects.

Abstract: Recent rehearsal-free continual learning (CL) methods guided by prompts
achieve strong performance on vision tasks with non-stationary data but remain
resource-intensive, hindering real-world edge deployment. We introduce
resource-efficient prompting (REP), which improves the computational and memory
efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free continual learning methods while
minimizing accuracy trade-offs. Our approach employs swift prompt selection to
refine input data using a carefully provisioned model and introduces adaptive
token merging (AToM) and adaptive layer dropping (ALD) for efficient prompt
updates. AToM and ALD selectively skip data and model layers while preserving
task-specific features during the learning of new tasks. Extensive experiments
on multiple image classification datasets demonstrate REP's superior resource
efficiency over state-of-the-art rehearsal-free CL methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed
machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to
remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over
wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to
adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is
particularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models
(LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors
essential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are
provided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an
expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is
upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a
physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM)
over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather
information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of
devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly
optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive
experiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness,
achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The
proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component,
where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model's resilience
to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more
noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially
when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in
particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the
need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
models without sharing raw data, but is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and
data heterogeneity, which can severely degrade performance. Existing
Byzantine-robust approaches tackle data heterogeneity, but incur high
computational overhead during gradient aggregation, thereby slowing down the
training process. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective
Federated Normalized Gradients Algorithm (Fed-NGA), which performs aggregation
by merely computing the weighted mean of the normalized gradients from each
client. This approach yields a favorable time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(pM)$,
where $p$ is the model dimension and $M$ is the number of clients. We
rigorously prove that Fed-NGA is robust to both Byzantine faults and data
heterogeneity. For non-convex loss functions, Fed-NGA achieves convergence to a
neighborhood of stationary points under general assumptions, and further
attains zero optimality gap under some mild conditions, which is an outcome
rarely achieved in existing literature. In both cases, the convergence rate is
$\mathcal{O}(1/T^{\frac{1}{2} - \delta})$, where $T$ denotes the number of
iterations and $\delta \in (0, 1/2)$. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets confirm the superior time efficiency and convergence performance of
Fed-NGA over existing methods.

diverse perturbational datasets, and a set of metrics designed to fairly
compare models and dissect their performance. Through extensive evaluation of
both published and baseline models across diverse datasets, we highlight the
limitations of widely used models, such as mode collapse. We also demonstrate
the importance of rank metrics which complement traditional model fit measures,
such as RMSE, for validating model effectiveness. Notably, our results show
that while no single model architecture clearly outperforms others, simpler
architectures are generally competitive and scale well with larger datasets.
Overall, this benchmarking exercise sets new standards for model evaluation,
supports robust model development, and furthers the use of these models to
simulate genetic and chemical screens for therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Reward shaping is effective in addressing the sparse-reward challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL) by providing immediate feedback through auxiliary,
informative rewards. Based on the reward shaping strategy, we propose a novel
multi-task reinforcement learning framework that integrates a centralized
reward agent (CRA) and multiple distributed policy agents. The CRA functions as
a knowledge pool, aimed at distilling knowledge from various tasks and
distributing it to individual policy agents to improve learning efficiency.
Specifically, the shaped rewards serve as a straightforward metric for encoding
knowledge. This framework not only enhances knowledge sharing across
established tasks but also adapts to new tasks by transferring meaningful
reward signals. We validate the proposed method on both discrete and continuous
domains, including the representative Meta-World benchmark, demonstrating its
robustness in multi-task sparse-reward settings and its effective
transferability to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning trains policies using
pre-collected datasets and learned environment models, eliminating the need for
direct real-world environment interaction. However, this paradigm is inherently
challenged by distribution shift~(DS). Existing methods address this issue by
leveraging off-policy mechanisms and estimating model uncertainty, but they
often result in inconsistent objectives and lack a unified theoretical
foundation. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis that disentangles the
problem into two fundamental components: model bias and policy shift. Our
theoretical and empirical investigations reveal how these factors distort value
estimation and restrict policy optimization. To tackle these challenges, we
derive a novel shifts-aware reward through a unified probabilistic inference
framework, which modifies the vanilla reward to refine value learning and
facilitate policy training. Building on this, we develop a practical
implementation that leverages classifier-based techniques to approximate the
adjusted reward for effective policy optimization. Empirical results across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach mitigates
distribution shift and achieves superior or comparable performance, validating
our theoretical insights.

Abstract: The classical line search for learning rate (LR) tuning in the stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) algorithm can tame the convergence slowdown due to
data-sampling noise. In a federated setting, wherein the client heterogeneity
introduces a slowdown to the global convergence, line search can be relevantly
adapted. In this work, we show that a stochastic variant of line search tames
the heterogeneity in federated optimization in addition to that due to
client-local gradient noise. To this end, we introduce Federated Stochastic
Line Search (FedSLS) algorithm and show that it achieves deterministic rates in
expectation. Specifically, FedSLS offers linear convergence for strongly convex
objectives even with partial client participation. Recently, the extrapolation
of the server's LR has shown promise for improved empirical performance for
federated learning. To benefit from extrapolation, we extend FedSLS to
Federated Extrapolated Stochastic Line Search (FedExpSLS) and prove its
convergence. Our extensive empirical results show that the proposed methods
perform at par or better than the popular federated learning algorithms across
many convex and non-convex problems.

Abstract: The growing exploitation of Machine Learning (ML) in safety-critical
applications necessitates rigorous safety analysis. Hardware reliability
assessment is a major concern with respect to measuring the level of safety in
ML-based systems. Quantifying the reliability of emerging ML models, including
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is highly complex due to their enormous
size in terms of the number of parameters and computations. Conventionally,
Fault Injection (FI) is applied to perform a reliability measurement. However,
performing FI on modern-day CNNs is prohibitively time-consuming if an
acceptable confidence level is to be achieved. To speed up FI for large CNNs,
statistical FI (SFI) has been proposed, but its runtimes are still considerably
long.
  In this work, we introduce DeepVigor+, a scalable, fast, and accurate
semi-analytical method as an efficient alternative for reliability measurement
in CNNs. DeepVigor+ implements a fault propagation analysis model and attempts
to acquire Vulnerability Factors (VFs) as reliability metrics in an optimal
way. The results indicate that DeepVigor+ obtains VFs for CNN models with an
error less than $1\%$, i.e., the objective in SFI, but with $14.9$ up to $26.9$
times fewer simulations than the best-known state-of-the-art SFI. DeepVigor+
enables an accurate reliability analysis for large and deep CNNs within a few
minutes, rather than achieving the same results in days or weeks.

Abstract: Adaptive optimization is critical in federated learning, where enabling
adaptivity on both the server and client sides has proven essential for
achieving optimal performance. However, the scalability of such jointly
adaptive systems is often hindered by resource limitations in communication and
memory. In this paper, we introduce a class of efficient adaptive algorithms,
named $FedAda^2$ and its enhanced version $FedAda^2$++, designed specifically
for large-scale, cross-device federated environments. $FedAda^2$ optimizes
communication efficiency by avoiding the transfer of preconditioners between
the server and clients. Additionally, $FedAda^2$++ extends this approach by
incorporating memory-efficient adaptive optimizers on the client side, further
reducing on-device memory usage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that $FedAda^2$
and $FedAda^2$++ achieve the same convergence rates for general, non-convex
objectives as its more resource-intensive counterparts that directly integrate
joint adaptivity. Extensive empirical evaluations on image and text datasets
demonstrate both the advantages of joint adaptivity and the effectiveness of
$FedAda^2$/$FedAda^2$++.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) tend to accrue technical debt and suffer from
significant retraining costs when adapting to evolving requirements.
Modularizing DNNs offers the promise of improving their reusability. Previous
work has proposed techniques to decompose DNN models into modules both during
and after training. However, these strategies yield several shortcomings,
including significant weight overlaps and accuracy losses across modules,
restricted focus on convolutional layers only, and added complexity and
training time by introducing auxiliary masks to control modularity. In this
work, we propose MODA, an activation-driven modular training approach. MODA
promotes inherent modularity within a DNN model by directly regulating the
activation outputs of its layers based on three modular objectives: intra-class
affinity, inter-class dispersion, and compactness. MODA is evaluated using
three well-known DNN models and five datasets with varying sizes. This
evaluation indicates that, compared to the existing state-of-the-art, using
MODA yields several advantages: (1) MODA accomplishes modularization with 22%
less training time; (2) the resultant modules generated by MODA comprise up to
24x fewer weights and 37x less weight overlap while (3) preserving the original
model's accuracy without additional fine-tuning; in module replacement
scenarios, (4) MODA improves the accuracy of a target class by 12% on average
while ensuring minimal impact on the accuracy of other classes.

norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable
sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins,
sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this
framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation,
allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern.
Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and
provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used
post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all
through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis
as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks
on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall.
Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and
text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Langevin algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian
learning, particularly when the aim is to sample from the posterior
distribution of a parametric model, given the input data and the prior
distribution over the model parameters. Their stochastic versions such as
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) allow iterative learning based on
randomly sampled mini-batches of large datasets and are scalable to large
datasets. However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents
subject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms
cannot be applied. Instead, we employ decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) algorithms,
where Bayesian learning is performed collaboratively by a network of agents
without sharing individual data. Nonetheless, existing DE-SGLD algorithms
induce a bias at every agent that can negatively impact performance; this bias
persists even when using full batches and is attributable to network effects.
Motivated by the EXTRA algorithm and its generalizations for decentralized
optimization, we propose the generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin
dynamics, which eliminates this bias in the full-batch setting. Moreover, we
show that, in the mini-batch setting, our algorithm provides performance bounds
that significantly improve upon those of standard DE-SGLD algorithms in the
literature. Our numerical results also demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed approach.

Abstract: Given a fixed budget for total model size, one must choose between training a
single large model or combining the predictions of multiple smaller models. We
investigate this trade-off for ensembles of random-feature ridge regression
models in both the overparameterized and underparameterized regimes. Using
deterministic equivalent risk estimates, we prove that when a fixed number of
parameters is distributed among $K$ independently trained models, the
ridge-optimized test risk increases with $K$. Consequently, a single large
model achieves optimal performance. We then ask when ensembles can achieve
\textit{near}-optimal performance. In the overparameterized regime, we show
that, to leading order, the test error depends on ensemble size and model size
only through the total feature count, so that overparameterized ensembles
consistently achieve near-optimal performance. To understand underparameterized
ensembles, we derive scaling laws for the test risk as a function of total
parameter count when the ensemble size and parameters per ensemble member are
jointly scaled according to a ``growth exponent'' $\ell$. While the optimal
error scaling is always achieved by increasing model size with a fixed ensemble
size, our analysis identifies conditions on the kernel and task eigenstructure
under which near-optimal scaling laws can be obtained by joint scaling of
ensemble size and model size.

Abstract: Data errors, corruptions, and poisoning attacks during training pose a major
threat to the reliability of modern AI systems. While extensive effort has gone
into empirical mitigations, the evolving nature of attacks and the complexity
of data require a more principled, provable approach to robustly learn on such
data - and to understand how perturbations influence the final model. Hence, we
introduce MIBP-Cert, a novel certification method based on mixed-integer
bilinear programming (MIBP) that computes sound, deterministic bounds to
provide provable robustness even under complex threat models. By computing the
set of parameters reachable through perturbed or manipulated data, we can
predict all possible outcomes and guarantee robustness. To make solving this
optimization problem tractable, we propose a novel relaxation scheme that
bounds each training step without sacrificing soundness. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach to continuous and discrete data, as well as
different threat models - including complex ones that were previously out of
reach.

Abstract: As Earth's orbital satellite population grows exponentially, effective space
situational awareness becomes critical for collision prevention and sustainable
operations. Current approaches to monitor satellite behaviors rely on expert
knowledge and rule-based systems that scale poorly. Among essential monitoring
tasks, satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification, analyzing behaviors like
station-keeping maneuvers and drift operations, remains underdeveloped due to
aerospace system complexity, operational variability, and inconsistent
ephemerides sources. We propose a novel generative approach for satellite PoL
identification that significantly eliminates the dependence on expert
knowledge. The proposed approach leverages orbital elements and positional data
to enable automatic pattern discovery directly from observations. Our
implementation uses a diffusion model framework for end-to-end identification
without manual refinement or domain expertise. The architecture combines a
multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite
positional data with a conditional denoising process to generate accurate PoL
classifications. Through experiments across diverse real-world satellite
operational scenarios, our approach demonstrates superior identification
quality and robustness across varying data quality characteristics. A case
study using actual satellite data confirms the approach's transformative
potential for operational behavior pattern identification, enhanced tracking,
and space situational awareness.

Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations
provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that
represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal
graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN)
from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory
relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited
in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic
nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose
PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural
ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories
under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters.
We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference
across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

Abstract: Achieving high model robustness under adversarial settings is widely
recognized as demanding considerable training samples. Recent works propose
semi-supervised adversarial training (SSAT) methods with external unlabeled or
synthetically generated data, which are the current state-of-the-art. However,
SSAT requires substantial extra data to attain high robustness, resulting in
prolonged training time and increased memory usage. In this paper, we propose
unlabeled data reduction strategies to improve the efficiency of SSAT.
Specifically, we design novel latent clustering-based techniques to select or
generate a small critical subset of data samples near the model's decision
boundary. While focusing on boundary-adjacent points, our methods maintain a
balanced ratio between boundary and non-boundary data points to avoid
overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our methods can significantly reduce SSAT's data requirement and computation
costs while preserving its strong robustness advantages. In particular, our
latent-space selection scheme based on k-means clustering and our guided DDPM
fine-tuning approach with LCG-KM are the most effective, achieving nearly
identical robust accuracies with 5x to 10x less unlabeled data and
approximately 4x less total runtime.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant
success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology
and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges
due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor
products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this
limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer
architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv).
By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv
reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while
preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We
show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional
$\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate
that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing
approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric
information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable
and efficient molecular modeling.

Abstract: In multi-objective black-box optimization, the goal is typically to find
solutions that optimize a set of $T$ black-box objective functions, $f_1,
\ldots f_T$, simultaneously. Traditional approaches often seek a single
Pareto-optimal set that balances trade-offs among all objectives. In contrast,
we consider a problem setting that departs from this paradigm: finding a small
set of $K < T$ solutions, that collectively "cover" the $T$ objectives. A set
of solutions is defined as "covering" if, for each objective $f_1, \ldots f_T$,
there is at least one good solution. A motivating example for this problem
setting occurs in drug design. For example, we may have $T$ pathogens and aim
to identify a set of $K < T$ antibiotics such that at least one antibiotic can
be used to treat each pathogen. This problem, known as coverage optimization,
has yet to be tackled with the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework. To fill
this void, we develop Multi-Objective Coverage Bayesian Optimization (MOCOBO),
a BO algorithm for solving coverage optimization. Our approach is based on a
new acquisition function reminiscent of expected improvement in the vanilla BO
setup. We demonstrate the performance of our method on high-dimensional
black-box optimization tasks, including applications in peptide and molecular
design. Results show that the coverage of the $K < T$ solutions found by MOCOBO
matches or nearly matches the coverage of $T$ solutions obtained by optimizing
each objective individually. Furthermore, in in vitro experiments, the peptides
found by MOCOBO exhibited high potency against drug-resistant pathogens,
further demonstrating the potential of MOCOBO for drug discovery. All of our
code is publicly available at the following link:

Abstract: This work proposes a simple yet effective sampling framework for
combinatorial optimization (CO). Our method builds on discrete Langevin
dynamics (LD), an efficient gradient-guided generative paradigm. However, we
observe that directly applying LD often leads to limited exploration. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the Regularized Langevin Dynamics (RLD),
which enforces an expected distance between the sampled and current solutions,
effectively avoiding local minima. We develop two CO solvers on top of RLD, one
based on simulated annealing (SA), and the other one based on neural network
(NN). Empirical results on three classic CO problems demonstrate that both of
our methods can achieve comparable or better performance against the previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) SA- and NN-based solvers. In particular, our SA
algorithm reduces the runtime of the previous SOTA SA method by up to 80\%,
while achieving equal or superior performance. In summary, RLD offers a
promising framework for enhancing both traditional heuristics and NN models to
solve CO problems. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences,
they require substantial prefill computation and key-value (KV) cache, which
can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage in both prefill
and decoding stages. Recent works that compress KV caches with prefill
acceleration reduce this cost but inadvertently tie the prefill compute
reduction to the decoding KV budget. This coupling arises from overlooking the
layer-dependent variation of critical context, often leading to accuracy
degradation. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression
framework designed to reduce latency in both prefill and decoding by leveraging
the stabilization of token importance in later layers. FastKV performs
full-context computation until a Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) layer, which
forwards only the most informative tokens to subsequent layers. From these
propagated tokens, FastKV independently selects salient KV entries for caching,
thereby decoupling KV budget from the prefill compute reduction based on the
TSP decision. This independent control of the TSP rate and KV retention rate
enables flexible optimization of efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results
show that FastKV achieves speedups of up to 1.82$\times$ in prefill and
2.87$\times$ in decoding compared to the full-context baseline, while matching
the accuracy of the baselines that only accelerate the decoding stage. Our code
is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is highly resource-intensive due to
their massive number of parameters and the overhead of optimizer states. While
recent work has aimed to reduce memory consumption, such efforts often entail
trade-offs among memory efficiency, training time, and model performance. Yet,
true democratization of LLMs requires simultaneous progress across all three
dimensions. To this end, we propose SubTrack++ that leverages Grassmannian
gradient subspace tracking combined with projection-aware optimizers, enabling
Adam's internal statistics to adapt to subspace changes. Additionally,
employing recovery scaling, a technique that restores information lost through
low-rank projections, further enhances model performance. Our method
demonstrates SOTA convergence by exploiting Grassmannian geometry, reducing
pre-training wall-time by up to 65% and fine-tuning time by 36% compared to
existing SOTA methods, while maintaining the same memory footprint.

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of score-based diffusion processes that operate
directly in the representation space of Lie groups. Leveraging the framework of
Generalized Score Matching, we derive a class of Langevin dynamics that
decomposes as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling the
modeling of any target distribution on any (non-Abelian) Lie group. Standard
score-matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is
the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise
as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs),
introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through
experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in
real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and
modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking,
showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself.
We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by
reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the
modeling of transitions between complex data distributions.

Abstract: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language
models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such
as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed
budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it
fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the
optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this
paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse
attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we
propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse
attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show
that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to
$15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$
acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks
using First-Order (FO) optimizers presents significant computational
challenges. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address these by
freezing most model parameters and training only a small subset. However, PEFT
often underperforms compared to full fine-tuning when high task-specific
accuracy is required. Zeroth-Order (ZO) methods fine-tune the entire
pre-trained model without back-propagation, estimating gradients through
forward passes only. While memory-efficient, ZO methods suffer from slow
convergence and high sensitivity to prompt selection. We bridge these two
worlds with Bilevel-ZOFO, a bilevel optimization method that couples fast,
local FO-PEFT adaptation at the inner level with stable, memory-efficient ZO
updates of the full backbone at the outer level. The FO-PEFT inner loop
performs fast, low-memory local adaptation that reduces the variance of ZO
estimates and stabilizes the search, guiding the outer ZO updates of the full
backbone and reducing prompt sensitivity. In the mean time, the outer ZO
provides better generalization ability for PEFT. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees and empirically demonstrate that Bilevel-ZOFO
significantly outperforms existing ZO and FO-PEFT methods, achieving 2-4 times
faster training while maintaining similar memory efficiency. Additionally, we
show by updating the backbone with ZO and adapting only a tiny FO-PEFT block
per task, Bilevel-ZOFO combines full-model capacity with few-shot efficiency,
making it a very efficient meta-learning algorithm that quickly adapts to new
tasks.

Abstract: Randomized experiments are the preferred approach for evaluating the effects
of interventions, but they are costly and often yield estimates with
substantial uncertainty. On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging
foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially
attain higher statistical precision. However, the benefits of in silico
experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid
if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to
interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the
predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while
preserving valid statistical inference. Our estimator is consistent and
asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the standard
estimator based on experimental data alone. Importantly, these statistical
properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased. Empirical
results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers
substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20% in the
sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based
on experimental data alone.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through
self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success,
researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing
continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing
approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either
semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs
when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for
downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an
efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single
binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec
delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at
lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling
multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks
shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic
information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling. Demo samples

Abstract: While conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
various applications, they require abundant data to train from scratch, which
is often infeasible in practice. To address this issue, transfer learning has
emerged as an essential paradigm in small data regimes. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical underpinnings of transfer learning conditional
diffusion models remain unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step
towards understanding the sample efficiency of transfer learning conditional
diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. Inspired by
practical training procedures, we assume that there exists a low-dimensional
representation of conditions shared across all tasks. Our analysis shows that
with a well-learned representation from source tasks, the samplecomplexity of
target tasks can be reduced substantially. In addition, we investigate the
practical implications of our theoretical results in several real-world
applications of conditional diffusion models. Numerical experiments are also
conducted to verify our results.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, adapting to new tasks by simply conditioning on demonstrations
without parameter updates. Compelling empirical and theoretical evidence
suggests that ICL, as a general-purpose learner, could outperform task-specific
models. However, it remains unclear to what extent the transformers optimally
learn in-context compared to principled learning algorithms. To investigate
this, we employ a meta ICL framework in which each prompt defines a distinctive
regression task whose target function is drawn from a hierarchical
distribution, requiring inference over both the latent model class and
task-specific parameters. Within this setup, we benchmark sample complexity of
ICL against principled learning algorithms, including the Bayes optimal
estimator, under varying performance requirements. Our findings reveal a
striking dichotomy: while ICL initially matches the efficiency of a Bayes
optimal estimator, its efficiency significantly deteriorates in long context.
Through an information-theoretic analysis, we show that the diminishing
efficiency is inherent to ICL. These results clarify the trade-offs in adopting
ICL as a universal problem solver, motivating a new generation of on-the-fly
adaptive methods without the diminishing efficiency.

Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising approach to enabling
memory-efficient training of large language models (LLMs). Existing low-rank
optimization methods typically project gradients onto a low-rank subspace,
reducing the memory cost of storing optimizer states. A key challenge in these
methods is selecting suitable subspaces to ensure an effective optimization
trajectory. Most existing approaches select the dominant subspace to preserve
gradient information, as this intuitively provides the best approximation.
However, we find that in practice, the dominant subspace stops changing during
pretraining, thereby constraining weight updates to similar subspaces. In this
paper, we propose importance sampling for low-rank optimization in LLM
pretraining with a provable convergence guarantee, which the dominant subspace
approach does not have. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods in LLM pretraining tasks.

Abstract: As the economic and environmental costs of training and deploying large
vision or language models increase dramatically, analog in-memory computing
(AIMC) emerges as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, the training
perspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC
hardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive
elements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses. While the conductance
changes by a constant in response to each pulse, in reality, the change is
scaled by asymmetric and non-linear response functions, leading to a non-ideal
training dynamic. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for
gradient-based training on AIMC hardware with non-ideal response functions. We
demonstrate that asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by
imposing an implicit penalty on the objective. To overcome the issue, we
propose Residual Learning algorithm, which provably converges exactly to a
critical point by solving a bilevel optimization problem. We demonstrate that
the proposed method can be extended to address other hardware imperfections,
such as limited response granularity. As we know, it is the first paper to
investigate the impact of a class of generic non-ideal response functions. The
conclusion is supported by simulations validating our theoretical insights.

Abstract: The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning
meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of
informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability.
However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised
time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique
challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal
similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two
structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time
series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between
instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across
spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective
and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting
mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We
validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including
multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general
applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to
highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across
all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and
improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with
an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time
series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate
more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design
more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our
code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at

Abstract: We study the problem of preconditioning in sequential prediction. From the
theoretical lens of linear dynamical systems, we show that convolving the input
sequence corresponds to applying a polynomial to the hidden transition matrix.
Building on this insight, we propose a universal preconditioning method that
convolves the input with coefficients from orthogonal polynomials such as
Chebyshev or Legendre. We prove that this approach reduces regret for two
distinct prediction algorithms and yields the first ever sublinear and
hidden-dimension independent regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) that
hold for systems with marginally stable and asymmetric transition matrices.
Finally, extensive synthetic and real-world experiments show that this simple
preconditioning strategy improves the performance of a diverse range of
algorithms, including recurrent neural networks, and generalizes to signals
beyond linear dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown remarkable
success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences.
Traditional RLHF methods rely on a fixed dataset, which often suffers from
limited coverage. To this end, online RLHF has emerged as a promising
direction, enabling iterative data collection and refinement. Despite its
potential, this paradigm faces a key bottleneck: the requirement to
continuously integrate new data into the dataset and re-optimize the model from
scratch at each iteration, resulting in computational and storage costs that
grow linearly with the number of iterations. In this work, we address this
challenge by proposing a one-pass reward modeling method that eliminates the
need to store historical data and achieves constant-time updates per iteration.
Specifically, we first formalize RLHF as a contextual preference bandit and
develop a new algorithm based on online mirror descent with a tailored local
norm, replacing the standard maximum likelihood estimation for reward modeling.
We then apply it to various online RLHF settings, including passive data
collection, active data collection, and deployment-time adaptation. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that our method enhances both statistical and
computational efficiency. Finally, we design practical algorithms for LLMs and
conduct experiments with the Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models
on Ultrafeedback and Mixture2 datasets, validating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits, where input
contexts are mapped into subsets of size $m$ of a collection of $K$ possible
actions. In each round, the learner observes the realized reward of the
predicted actions. Motivated by prototypical applications of contextual
bandits, we focus on the $s$-sparse regime where we assume that the sum of
rewards is bounded by some value $s\ll K$. For example, in recommendation
systems the number of products purchased by any customer is significantly
smaller than the total number of available products. Our main result is for the
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for which we design an algorithm
that returns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability using a sample
complexity of $\tilde{O}((poly(K/m)+sm/\epsilon^2) \log(|\Pi|/\delta))$ where
$\Pi$ is the underlying (finite) class and $s$ is the sparsity parameter. This
bound improves upon known bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits whenever $s\ll
K$, and in the regime where $s=O(1)$, the leading terms in our bound match the
corresponding full-information rates, implying that bandit feedback essentially
comes at no cost. Our algorithm is also computationally efficient given access
to an ERM oracle for $\Pi$. Our framework generalizes the list multiclass
classification problem with bandit feedback, which can be seen as a special
case with binary reward vectors. In the special case of single-label
classification corresponding to $s=m=1$, we prove an
$O((K^7+1/\epsilon^2)\log(|H|/\delta))$ sample complexity bound, which improves
upon recent results in this scenario. Additionally, we consider the regret
minimization setting where data can be generated adversarially, and establish a
regret bound of $\tilde O(|\Pi|+\sqrt{smT\log |\Pi|})$, extending the result of
Erez et al. (2024) who consider the simpler single label classification
setting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are models that leverage the graph structure to
transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing
operation. While widely successful, this approach is well known to suffer from
the over-smoothing and over-squashing phenomena, which result in
representational collapse as the number of layers increases and insensitivity
to the information contained at distant and poorly connected nodes,
respectively. In this paper, we present a unified view of these problems
through the lens of vanishing gradients, using ideas from linear control theory
for our analysis. We propose an interpretation of GNNs as recurrent models and
empirically demonstrate that a simple state-space formulation of a GNN
effectively alleviates over-smoothing and over-squashing at no extra trainable
parameter cost. Further, we show theoretically and empirically that (i) GNNs
are by design prone to extreme gradient vanishing even after a few layers; (ii)
Over-smoothing is directly related to the mechanism causing vanishing
gradients; (iii) Over-squashing is most easily alleviated by a combination of
graph rewiring and vanishing gradient mitigation. We believe our work will help
bridge the gap between the recurrent and graph neural network literature and
will unlock the design of new deep and performant GNNs.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are neural networks that learn a concept extractor to
map inputs to high-level concepts and an inference layer to translate these
into predictions. Ensuring these modules produce interpretable concepts and
behave reliably in out-of-distribution is crucial, yet the conditions for
achieving this remain unclear. We study this problem by establishing a novel
connection between Concept-based Models and reasoning shortcuts (RSs), a common
issue where models achieve high accuracy by learning low-quality concepts, even
when the inference layer is fixed and provided upfront. Specifically, we extend
RSs to the more complex setting of Concept-based Models and derive theoretical
conditions for identifying both the concepts and the inference layer. Our
empirical results highlight the impact of RSs and show that existing methods,
even combined with multiple natural mitigation strategies, often fail to meet
these conditions in practice.

Abstract: Forecasting Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) has recently emerged as
a distinct research field, necessitating specialized models to address its
unique challenges. While most forecasting literature assumes regularly spaced
observations without missing values, many real-world datasets - particularly in
healthcare, climate research, and biomechanics - violate these assumptions.
Time Series (TS)-mixer models have achieved remarkable success in regular
multivariate time series forecasting. However, they remain unexplored for IMTS
due to their requirement for complete and evenly spaced observations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce IMTS-Mixer, a novel forecasting architecture designed
specifically for IMTS. Our approach retains the core principles of TS mixer
models while introducing innovative methods to transform IMTS into fixed-size
matrix representations, enabling their seamless integration with mixer modules.
We evaluate IMTS-Mixer on a benchmark of four real-world datasets from various
domains. Our results demonstrate that IMTS-Mixer establishes a new
state-of-the-art in forecasting accuracy while also improving computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) demonstrates the advantage of aligning a
large language model with human preference using only an offline dataset.
However, DPO has the limitation that the KL penalty, which prevents excessive
deviation from the reference model, is static throughout the training process.
Several methods claim to change this static KL penalty of DPO into a dynamic
one, but no approach can adaptively assign different KL penalties for each
preference pair. In this paper, we propose $\varepsilon$-Direct Preference
Optimization ($\varepsilon$-DPO), which allows adaptive control of the KL
penalty strength $\beta$ for each preference pair. Specifically,
$\varepsilon$-DPO adaptively controls $\beta$ for each preference pair based on
the monotonicity of logits as a preference model under the perturbation of
$\beta$ during training. This is equivalent to adjusting the KL penalty by
checking whether the change in training-time temperature can lead to better
preference confidence as preference models by simply reusing the logit of the
current policy and the reference policy. Experimental results show that the
simple criterion of $\varepsilon$-DPO for KL penalty relaxation significantly
improves DPO compared to most existing direct alignment algorithms on general
chatbot benchmarks and reveal that this KL penalty control criterion can
reflect confusion as a preference model and provide an efficient KL trade-off,
highlighting the significance of instance-level adaptive KL penalty control in
DPO.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is a crucial task in various domains, yet
existing TSF models rely heavily on high-quality data and insufficiently
exploit all available data. This paper explores a novel self-supervised
approach to re-label time series datasets by inherently constructing candidate
datasets. During the optimization of a simple reconstruction network,
intermediates are used as pseudo labels in a self-supervised paradigm,
improving generalization for any predictor. We introduce the Self-Correction
with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), which discards overfitted components and selectively
replaces them with pseudo labels generated from reconstructions. Additionally,
we incorporate Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) to further suppress
overfitting from a loss landscape perspective. Our experiments on eleven
real-world datasets demonstrate that SCAM consistently improves the performance
of various backbone models. This work offers a new perspective on constructing
datasets and enhancing the generalization of TSF models through self-supervised
learning. The code is available at https://github.com/SuDIS-ZJU/SCAM.

Abstract: Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system
dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods
often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that
integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large
Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable
explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time
series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside
case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which
refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and
explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the
ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this
feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers
encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow-prediction, critique (reflect),
and refinement-continuously boosts the framework's performance and
interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate
that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric,
multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for
time series prediction.

Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM
agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when
the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we
propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the
attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects
malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via
queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit
a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target
query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we
introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious
reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt
that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a
progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt,
such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later
victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the
effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements
for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting
the risk.

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human
raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a
critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such
judge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting
multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating
the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however,
rating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM
rater may deem multiple ratings "reasonable" or "correct." We call this
condition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain
rating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are
instructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce
a framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy.
We draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system
performance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different
rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in
how humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy when responding to
forced-choice rating instructions can heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation.
Through extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 9
commercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon
forced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal,
performing as much as 31% worse than judge systems selected by our approach
that uses multi-label "response set" ratings to account for rating
indeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled
approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical for
real-world deployment, yet existing methods like RLHF face computational and
stability challenges. While DPO establishes an offline paradigm with single
hyperparameter $\beta$, subsequent methods like SimPO reintroduce complexity
through dual parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$). We propose {ReLU-based Preference
Optimization (RePO)}, a streamlined algorithm that eliminates $\beta$ via two
advances: (1) retaining SimPO's reference-free margins but removing $\beta$
through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that
naturally filters trivial pairs. Theoretically, RePO is characterized as
SimPO's limiting case ($\beta \to \infty$), where the logistic weighting
collapses to binary thresholding, forming a convex envelope of the 0-1 loss.
Empirical results on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that RePO outperforms DPO
and SimPO across multiple base models, requiring only one hyperparameter to
tune.

statistical properties of weak-to-strong learning remain less understood in the

labels. In this work, we propose a new agnostic boosting algorithm with
substantially improved sample complexity compared to prior works under very
general assumptions. Our approach is based on a reduction to the realizable
case, followed by a margin-based filtering of high-quality hypotheses.
Furthermore, we show a nearly-matching lower bound, settling the sample
complexity of agnostic boosting up to logarithmic factors.

Abstract: Water quality is foundational to environmental sustainability, ecosystem

for large-scale water quality prediction and scientific insights generation.
However, their widespread adoption in high-stakes operational decision-making,
such as pollution mitigation and equitable resource allocation, is prevented by
unresolved trustworthiness challenges, including performance disparity,
robustness, uncertainty, interpretability, generalizability, and
reproducibility. In this work, we present a multi-dimensional, quantitative
evaluation of trustworthiness benchmarking three state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures: recurrent (LSTM), operator-learning (DeepONet), and
transformer-based (Informer), trained on 37 years of data from 482 U.S. basins
to predict 20 water quality variables. Our investigation reveals systematic
performance disparities tied to process complexity, data availability, and
basin heterogeneity. Management-critical variables remain the least predictable
and most uncertain. Robustness tests reveal pronounced sensitivity to outliers
and corrupted targets; notably, the architecture with the strongest baseline
performance (LSTM) proves most vulnerable under data corruption. Attribution
analyses align for simple variables but diverge for nutrients, underscoring the
need for multi-method interpretability. Spatial generalization to ungauged
basins remains poor across all models. This work serves as a timely call to
action for advancing trustworthy data-driven methods for water resources
management and provides a pathway to offering critical insights for
researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners seeking to leverage artificial

This approach enhances predictive reliability, fairness, and interpretability,

Abstract: Although federated learning has gained prominence as a privacy-preserving
framework tailored for distributed Internet of Things (IoT) environments,
current federated principal component analysis (PCA) methods lack integration
of sparsity, a critical feature for robust anomaly detection. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel federated structured sparse PCA (FedSSP)
approach for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model uniquely
integrates double sparsity regularization: (1) row-wise sparsity governed by
$\ell_{2,p}$-norm with $p\in[0,1)$ to eliminate redundant feature dimensions,
and (2) element-wise sparsity via $\ell_{q}$-norm with $q\in[0,1)$ to suppress
noise-sensitive components. To efficiently solve this non-convex optimization
problem in a distributed setting, we devise a proximal alternating minimization
(PAM) algorithm with rigorous theoretical proofs establishing its convergence
guarantees. Experiments on real datasets validate that incorporating structured
sparsity enhances both model interpretability and detection accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a new graph diffusion model for small molecule generation, DMol,
which outperforms the state-of-the-art DiGress model in terms of validity by
roughly 1.5% across all benchmarking datasets while reducing the number of
diffusion steps by at least 10-fold, and the running time to roughly one half.
The performance improvements are a result of a careful change in the objective
function and a graph noise scheduling approach which, at each diffusion step,
allows one to only change a subset of nodes of varying size in the molecule
graph. Another relevant property of the method is that it can be easily
combined with junction-tree-like graph representations that arise by
compressing a collection of relevant ring structures into supernodes. Unlike
classical junction-tree techniques that involve VAEs and require complicated
reconstruction steps, compressed DMol directly performs graph diffusion on a
graph that compresses only a carefully selected set of frequent carbon rings
into supernodes, which results in straightforward sample generation. This
compressed DMol method offers additional validity improvements over generic
DMol of roughly 2%, increases the novelty of the method, and further improves
the running time due to reductions in the graph size.

Abstract: Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) forecasting is vital for
decision-making in agriculture, energy production, and emergency management.
However, it remains a challenging and underexplored problem due to the chaotic
nature of the weather system. Recent data-driven studies have shown promising
results, but their performance is limited by the inadequate incorporation of
climate states and a model tendency to degrade, progressively losing fine-scale
details and yielding over-smoothed forecasts. To overcome these limitations, we
propose TianQuan-S2S, a global S2S forecasting model that integrates initial
weather states with climatological means via incorporating climatology into

Abstract: Post-hoc, unsupervised concept-based explanation methods (U-CBEMs) translate
a vision model's internal reasoning into human-understandable concepts, leading
to interpretable explanations. However, we find that many state-of-the-art
(SOTA) U-CBEMs are not faithful: their concepts seem interpretable but fail to
reproduce the model's predictions. We argue that this deficiency has gone
unnoticed due to fragmented evaluation - each paper proposes its own
faithfulness measure, with no measure-over-measure comparison or broad
benchmarking. We close this gap by (i) organizing prior metrics in a unified
framework, discussing their limitations, and identifying desiderata for a
faithfulness measure; (ii) introducing the Surrogate Faithfulness (SURF)
measure, which quantifies faithfulness via the predictive loss of a surrogate
that maps explanations to the model's outputs; and (iii) delivering the first
comprehensive U-CBEM faithfulness benchmark across diverse tasks and
architectures. In a controlled setting, SURF outperforms prior faithfulness
measures in measure-over-measure comparisons, and applying SURF to SOTA U-CBEMs
reveals that many visually appealing U-CBEMs are surprisingly unfaithful. We
demonstrate SURF applicability in two downstream settings - (i) faithfulness
versus the number of concepts used in the explanation and (ii) U-CBEM
robustness to adversarial attacks - underscoring SURF's value as a reliable
faithfulness measure. Code to be released.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to
performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic
data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions
for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as
few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work,
we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models
for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN
-- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for
SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks
(NPE-PFN) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms
of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse
problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of
simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer
simulations. NPE-PFN eliminates the need for inference network selection,
training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior
robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets
that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PFN provides a new direction
for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient,
easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse
problems.

Abstract: Navigating in a fluid flow while being carried by it, using only information
accessible from on-board sensors, is a problem commonly faced by small
planktonic organisms. It is also directly relevant to autonomous robots
deployed in the oceans. In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community
has widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest
implementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the
strategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a
quantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation
in partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of
directional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically.
We then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used
algorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered
in the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and
two-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO
(Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established
dominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning
community. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the
theoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust
manner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques,
such as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well
as hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of
algorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering
truly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve
speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of
conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces
fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on
input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions,
off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when
deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated
recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic
method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet
exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly
adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach
enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including
Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain
performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the
presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show
that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can
be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show
that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better
scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input
quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient
analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems.
Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires
performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to
many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of
conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally
linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing
identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine
operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the
sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part
of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction
space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic
algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction
identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house
reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback
controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction
space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral
controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The
eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization,
leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the
Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both
reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight
conditions, due to its global nature.

Abstract: This paper studies the approximation and generalization abilities of
score-based neural network generative models (SGMs) in estimating an unknown
distribution $P_0$ from $n$ i.i.d. observations in $d$ dimensions. Assuming
merely that $P_0$ is $\alpha$-sub-Gaussian, we prove that for any time step $t
\in [t_0, n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}]$, where $t_0 > \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2n^{-2/d}\log
n)$, there exists a deep ReLU neural network with width $\leq
\mathcal{O}(n^{\frac{3}{d}}\log_2n)$ and depth $\leq \mathcal{O}(\log^2n)$ that
can approximate the scores with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{-1})$ mean square error
and achieve a nearly optimal rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{-1}t_0^{-d/2})$
for score estimation, as measured by the score matching loss. Our framework is
universal and can be used to establish convergence rates for SGMs under milder
assumptions than previous work. For example, assuming further that the target
density function $p_0$ lies in Sobolev or Besov classes, with an appropriately
early stopping strategy, we demonstrate that neural network-based SGMs can
attain nearly minimax convergence rates up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis
removes several crucial assumptions, such as Lipschitz continuity of the score
function or a strictly positive lower bound on the target density.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics from sparsely time-resolved snapshot data is crucial
for understanding complex cellular processes and behavior. Existing methods
leverage optimal transport, Schr\"odinger bridge theory, or their variants to
simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data.
However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for
cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios
since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can
influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we
formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schr\"odinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to
model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired
by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm
designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular
transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks,
CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data.
The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both
synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to
existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction
patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental
landscape with greater accuracy. Code is available at:

Abstract: Suppressor variables can influence model predictions without being dependent
on the target outcome, and they pose a significant challenge for Explainable AI
(XAI) methods. These variables may cause false-positive feature attributions,
undermining the utility of explanations. Although effective remedies exist for
linear models, their extension to non-linear models and instance-based
explanations has remained limited. We introduce PatternLocal, a novel XAI
technique that addresses this gap. PatternLocal begins with a locally linear
surrogate, e.g., LIME, KernelSHAP, or gradient-based methods, and transforms
the resulting discriminative model weights into a generative representation,
thereby suppressing the influence of suppressor variables while preserving
local fidelity. In extensive hyperparameter optimization on the XAI-TRIS
benchmark, PatternLocal consistently outperformed other XAI methods and reduced
false-positive attributions when explaining non-linear tasks, thereby enabling
more reliable and actionable insights. We further evaluate PatternLocal on an
EEG motor imagery dataset, demonstrating physiologically plausible
explanations.

Abstract: Recovering the dynamics from a few snapshots of a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task in statistical physics and machine learning, with important
applications in computational biology. Many algorithms have been developed to
tackle this problem, based on frameworks such as optimal transport and the
Schr\"odinger bridge. A notable recent framework is Regularized Unbalanced
Optimal Transport (RUOT), which integrates both stochastic dynamics and
unnormalized distributions. However, since many existing methods do not
explicitly enforce optimality conditions, their solutions often struggle to
satisfy the principle of least action and meet challenges to converge in a
stable and reliable way. To address these issues, we propose Variational RUOT
(Var-RUOT), a new framework to solve the RUOT problem. By incorporating the
optimal necessary conditions for the RUOT problem into both the
parameterization of the search space and the loss function design, Var-RUOT
only needs to learn a scalar field to solve the RUOT problem and can search for
solutions with lower action. We also examined the challenge of selecting a
growth penalty function in the widely used Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and
proposed a solution that better aligns with biological priors in Var-RUOT. We
validated the effectiveness of Var-RUOT on both simulated data and real
single-cell datasets. Compared with existing algorithms, Var-RUOT can find
solutions with lower action while exhibiting faster convergence and improved
training stability. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which introduces a product of two trainable
low-rank matrices into frozen pre-trained weights, is widely used for efficient
fine-tuning of language models in federated learning (FL). However, when
combined with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), LoRA
faces substantial noise amplification: DP-SGD perturbs per-sample gradients,
and the matrix multiplication of the LoRA update ($BA$) intensifies this
effect. Freezing one matrix (e.g., $A$) reduces the noise but restricts model
expressiveness, often resulting in suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we
propose $\texttt{FedSVD}$, a simple yet effective method that introduces a
global reparameterization based on singular value decomposition (SVD). In our
approach, each client optimizes only the $B$ matrix and transmits it to the
server. The server aggregates the $B$ matrices, computes the product $BA$ using
the previous $A$, and refactorizes the result via SVD. This yields a new
adaptive $A$ composed of the orthonormal right singular vectors of $BA$, and an
updated $B$ containing the remaining SVD components. This reparameterization
avoids quadratic noise amplification, while allowing $A$ to better capture the
principal directions of the aggregate updates. Moreover, the orthonormal
structure of $A$ bounds the gradient norms of $B$ and preserves more signal
under DP-SGD, as confirmed by our theoretical analysis. As a result,
$\texttt{FedSVD}$ consistently improves stability and performance across a
variety of privacy settings and benchmarks, outperforming relevant baselines
under both private and non-private regimes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated clustering (FC) aims to discover global cluster structures across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, making privacy preservation a
fundamental requirement. There are two critical challenges: (1) privacy leakage
during collaboration, and (2) robustness degradation due to aggregation of
proxy information from non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID)
local data, leading to inaccurate or inconsistent global clustering. Existing
solutions typically rely on model-specific local proxies, which are sensitive
to data heterogeneity and inherit inductive biases from their centralized
counterparts, thus limiting robustness and generality. We propose Omni
Federated Clustering (OmniFC), a unified and model-agnostic framework.
Leveraging Lagrange coded computing, our method enables clients to share only
encoded data, allowing exact reconstruction of the global distance matrix--a
fundamental representation of sample relationships--without leaking private
information, even under client collusion. This construction is naturally
resilient to Non-IID data distributions. This approach decouples FC from
model-specific proxies, providing a unified extension mechanism applicable to
diverse centralized clustering methods. Theoretical analysis confirms both
reconstruction fidelity and privacy guarantees, while comprehensive experiments
demonstrate OmniFC's superior robustness, effectiveness, and generality across
various benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) alleviates the cost of data labeling process
by exploiting unlabeled data and has achieved promising results. Meanwhile,
with the development of large foundation models, exploiting pre-trained models
becomes a promising way to address the label scarcity in the downstream tasks,
such as various parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. This raises a
natural yet critical question: When labeled data is limited, should we rely on
unlabeled data or pre-trained models? To investigate this issue, we conduct a
fair comparison between SSL methods and pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP) on
representative image classification tasks under a controlled supervision
budget. Experiments reveal that SSL has met its ``Waterloo" in the era of large
models, as pre-trained models show both high efficiency and strong performance
on widely adopted SSL benchmarks. This underscores the urgent need for SSL
researchers to explore new avenues, such as deeper integration between the SSL
and pre-trained models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of
Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image classification tasks.
Results show that, despite their massive parameter scales, MLLMs still face
significant performance limitations, highlighting that even a seemingly
well-studied task remains highly challenging.

Abstract: World models predict state transitions in response to actions and are

objectives such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) often misalign with
task-specific goals of world models, i.e., transition prediction metrics like
accuracy or perceptual quality. In this paper, we present RLVR-World, a unified
framework that leverages reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
to directly optimize world models for such metrics. Despite formulating world
modeling as autoregressive prediction of tokenized sequences, RLVR-World
evaluates metrics of decoded predictions as verifiable rewards. We demonstrate
substantial performance gains on both language- and video-based world models
across domains, including text games, web navigation, and robot manipulation.
Our work indicates that, beyond recent advances in reasoning language models,
RLVR offers a promising post-training paradigm for enhancing the utility of
generative models more broadly. Code, datasets, models, and video samples are

bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth

Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time.
Experiments show that ABCD improves performance across diverse tasks while

Abstract: Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential
equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems
by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the
characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics.
Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they
have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned
latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This
mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this
work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating
differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the
latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly
by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong
correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by
accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters,
enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining
continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore,
$\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained
or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a
flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We
demonstrate the framework's robustness across various PDE solvers and highlight
its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation that is
readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers, available

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling
relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way
relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to
this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial
representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate
higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through
Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability
challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing
routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation
mechanism. This work presents HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural
Encoder), an alternative method to solve tasks involving higher-order
interactions \emph{without message passing}. Instead, HOPSE breaks
\emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships
using a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the
representation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes
results in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP.
The experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that
HOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP
methods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\times$ speedups over
HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.

Abstract: We present new fast-rate PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for multi-task
and meta-learning in the unbalanced setting, i.e. when the tasks have training
sets of different sizes, as is typically the case in real-world scenarios.
Previously, only standard-rate bounds were known for this situation, while
fast-rate bounds were limited to the setting where all training sets are of
equal size. Our new bounds are numerically computable as well as interpretable,
and we demonstrate their flexibility in handling a number of cases where they
give stronger guarantees than previous bounds. Besides the bounds themselves,
we also make conceptual contributions: we demonstrate that the unbalanced
multi-task setting has different statistical properties than the balanced
situation, specifically that proofs from the balanced situation do not carry
over to the unbalanced setting. Additionally, we shed light on the fact that
the unbalanced situation allows two meaningful definitions of multi-task risk,
depending on whether all tasks should be considered equally important or if
sample-rich tasks should receive more weight than sample-poor ones.

Abstract: For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs,
Bellman's Principle of Optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning
(RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation,
the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a
priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of
dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We
address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free
approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding
temporal difference method. We establish exponential convergence of the
idealized continuous-time dynamics and empirically demonstrate its potential
advantages over transition-kernel-based formulations. The proposed formulation
paves the way toward bridging stochastic control and model-free reinforcement
learning.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a central issue in ML, and it has become
standard practice to adjust ML algorithms so that they will satisfy fairness
requirements such as Equal Opportunity. In this paper we consider the effects
of adopting such fair classifiers on the overall level of ecosystem fairness.
Specifically, we introduce the study of fairness with competing firms, and
demonstrate the failure of fair classifiers in yielding fair ecosystems. Our
results quantify the loss of fairness in systems, under a variety of
conditions, based on classifiers' correlation and the level of their data
overlap. We show that even if competing classifiers are individually fair, the
ecosystem's outcome may be unfair; and that adjusting biased algorithms to
improve their individual fairness may lead to an overall decline in ecosystem
fairness. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide supporting

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of nonparametric
regression, a fundamental problem in machine learning, under the setting where
an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a subset of the input data. While the
robustness of parametric regression has been extensively studied, its
nonparametric counterpart remains largely unexplored. We characterize the
adversarial robustness in nonparametric regression, assuming the regression
function belongs to the second-order Sobolev space (i.e., it is square
integrable up to its second derivative).
  The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) we establish a minimax lower
bound on the estimation error, revealing a fundamental limit that no estimator
can overcome, and (ii) we show that, perhaps surprisingly, the classical
smoothing spline estimator, when properly regularized, exhibits robustness
against adversarial corruption. These results imply that if $o(n)$ out of $n$
samples are corrupted, the estimation error of the smoothing spline vanishes as
$n \to \infty$. On the other hand, when a constant fraction of the data is
corrupted, no estimator can guarantee vanishing estimation error, implying the
optimality of the smoothing spline in terms of maximum tolerable number of
corrupted samples.

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant
computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation
methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference,
reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on
non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN
layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down
projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN,
leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct
coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that
D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5%
ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4%
better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized
kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into
substantial real-world acceleration.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown strong performance in geospatial prediction tasks,
but the role of geolocation information in improving accuracy and
generalizability remains underexamined. Recent work has introduced location
encoders that aim to represent spatial context in a transferable way, yet most
evaluations have focused on static mapping tasks. Here, we study the effect of
incorporating geolocation into deep learning for a dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous application: estimating daily surface-level PM2.5 across the
contiguous United States using satellite and ground-based observations. We
compare three strategies for representing location: excluding geolocation,
using raw latitude and longitude, and using pretrained location encoders. We
evaluate each under within-region and out-of-region generalization settings.
Results show that raw coordinates can improve performance within regions by
supporting spatial interpolation, but can reduce generalizability across
regions. In contrast, pretrained location encoders such as GeoCLIP improve both
predictive accuracy and geographic transfer. However, we also observe spatial
artifacts linked to encoder characteristics, and performance varies across
encoder types (e.g., SatCLIP vs. GeoCLIP). This work provides the first
systematic evaluation of location encoders in a dynamic environmental
estimation context and offers guidance for incorporating geolocation into deep
learning models for geospatial prediction.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks,
but suffer from a notable quadratic complexity in sequence length due to the
attention mechanism. In this work, we propose MonarchAttention -- a novel
approach to sub-quadratic attention approximation via Monarch matrices, an
expressive class of structured matrices. Based on the variational form of
softmax, we describe an efficient optimization-based algorithm to compute an
approximate projection of softmax attention onto the class of Monarch matrices
with $\Theta(N\sqrt{N} d)$ computational complexity and $\Theta(Nd)$ memory/IO
complexity. Unlike previous approaches, MonarchAttention is both (1)
transferable, yielding minimal performance loss with no additional training,
even when replacing every attention layer of the Transformer, and (2)
hardware-efficient, utilizing the highest-throughput tensor core units on
modern GPUs. With optimized kernels, MonarchAttention achieves substantial
speed-ups in wall-time over FlashAttention-2: $1.4\times$ for shorter sequences
$(N=256)$, $4.5\times$ for medium-length sequences $(N=4K)$, and $8.2\times$
for longer sequences $(N=16K)$. We demonstrate the quality of MonarchAttention
on diverse tasks and architectures in vision and language problems, showing
that it flexibly and accurately approximates softmax attention in a variety of
contexts. Our code is available at

Abstract: Contextual multi-armed bandit is a fundamental learning framework for making
a sequence of decisions, e.g., advertising recommendations for a sequence of
arriving users. Recent works have shown that clustering these users based on
the similarity of their learned preferences can accelerate the learning.
However, prior work has primarily focused on the online setting, which requires
continually collecting user data, ignoring the offline data widely available in
many applications. To tackle these limitations, we study the offline clustering
of bandits (Off-ClusBand) problem, which studies how to use the offline dataset
to learn cluster properties and improve decision-making. The key challenge in
Off-ClusBand arises from data insufficiency for users: unlike the online case
where we continually learn from online data, in the offline case, we have a
fixed, limited dataset to work from and thus must determine whether we have
enough data to confidently cluster users together. To address this challenge,
we propose two algorithms: Off-C2LUB, which we show analytically and
experimentally outperforms existing methods under limited offline user data,
and Off-CLUB, which may incur bias when data is sparse but performs well and
nearly matches the lower bound when data is sufficient. We experimentally
validate these results on both real and synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable
method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This
paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match
the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of
the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution
without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the
generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which
prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman
preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that
provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality.
BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all
instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop
scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be
used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is
applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike
other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a
trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve
both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to
Llama-3-8B-Instruct, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B
backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2. Project

Abstract: Actor-Critic methods are widely used for their scalability, yet existing
theoretical guarantees for infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) often rely on restrictive ergodicity assumptions. We propose
NAC-B, a Natural Actor-Critic with Batching, that achieves order-optimal regret
of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ in infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs under the
unichain assumption, which permits both transient states and periodicity. This
assumption is among the weakest under which the classic policy gradient theorem
remains valid for average-reward settings. NAC-B employs function approximation
for both the actor and the critic, enabling scalability to problems with large
state and action spaces. The use of batching in our algorithm helps mitigate
potential periodicity in the MDP and reduces stochasticity in gradient
estimates, and our analysis formalizes these benefits through the introduction
of the constants $C_{\text{hit}}$ and $C_{\text{tar}}$, which characterize the
rate at which empirical averages over Markovian samples converge to the
stationary distribution.

Abstract: Despite the significant potential of FP8 data formats for large language
model (LLM) pre-training, their adoption has been limited due to challenges in
maintaining stability at scale. Existing approaches often rely on suboptimal
fine-grained FP8 kernels or fall back to higher-precision matrix
multiplications (GEMMs) in sensitive components, such as attention projections,
compromising potential throughput gains. We introduce a new class of LLM
architectures that, for the first time, support FP8 computation for all GEMMs
within transformer blocks during both forward and backward passes. This enables
unprecedented throughput gains, particularly at scale, while matching the
downstream performance of standard BF16 training. Our architecture design
reduces large outlier activations, promoting stable long-term FP8 training. In
addition, we identify key metrics to monitor low-precision training and predict
potential future divergences.

Abstract: We introduce copresheaf topological neural networks (CTNNs), a powerful
unifying framework that encapsulates a wide spectrum of deep learning
architectures, designed to operate on structured data, including images, point
clouds, graphs, meshes, and topological manifolds. While deep learning has
profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous
systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific
tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open
challenges. CTNNs address this gap by formulating model design in the language
of copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes most
practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet constructive
formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically sound and
practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core challenges in
representation learning, such as long-range dependencies, oversmoothing,
heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured
data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional
baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized
sensitivity. These results establish CTNNs as a principled multi-scale
foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating
visual content from text inputs. Although multiple safety alignment strategies
have been proposed to prevent harmful outputs, they often lead to overly
cautious behavior -- rejecting even benign prompts -- a phenomenon known as
$\textit{over-refusal}$ that reduces the practical utility of T2I models.
Despite over-refusal having been observed in practice, there is no large-scale
benchmark that systematically evaluates this phenomenon for T2I models. In this
paper, we present an automatic workflow to construct synthetic evaluation data,
resulting in OVERT ($\textbf{OVE}$r-$\textbf{R}$efusal evaluation on
$\textbf{T}$ext-to-image models), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing
over-refusal behaviors in T2I models. OVERT includes 4,600 seemingly harmful
but benign prompts across nine safety-related categories, along with 1,785
genuinely harmful prompts (OVERT-unsafe) to evaluate the safety-utility
trade-off. Using OVERT, we evaluate several leading T2I models and find that
over-refusal is a widespread issue across various categories (Figure 1),
underscoring the need for further research to enhance the safety alignment of
T2I models without compromising their functionality. As a preliminary attempt
to reduce over-refusal, we explore prompt rewriting; however, we find it often
compromises faithfulness to the meaning of the original prompts. Finally, we
demonstrate the flexibility of our generation framework in accommodating
diverse safety requirements by generating customized evaluation data adapting
to user-defined policies.

Abstract: Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous
computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a
parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the
restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing
(LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the
capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank
subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks
with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters.
LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank
baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with
low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently
improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with
negligible cost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scaling limits, such as infinite-width limits, serve as promising theoretical
tools to study large-scale models. However, it is widely believed that existing
infinite-width theory does not faithfully explain the behavior of practical
networks, especially those trained in standard parameterization (SP) meaning He
initialization with a global learning rate. For instance, existing theory for
SP predicts instability at large learning rates and vanishing feature learning
at stable ones. In practice, however, optimal learning rates decay slower than
theoretically predicted and networks exhibit both stable training and
non-trivial feature learning, even at very large widths. Here, we show that
this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width phenomena.
  Instead, we find a resolution through a finer-grained analysis of the regime
previously considered unstable and therefore uninteresting. In particular, we
show that, under cross-entropy (CE) loss, the unstable regime comprises two
distinct sub-regimes: a catastrophically unstable regime and a more benign
controlled divergence regime, where logits diverge but gradients and
activations remain stable. Moreover, under large learning rates at the edge of
the controlled divergence regime, there exists a well-defined infinite width
limit where features continue to evolve in all the hidden layers. In
experiments across optimizers, architectures, and data modalities, we validate
that neural networks operate in this controlled divergence regime under CE loss
but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence suggests that width-scaling
considerations are surprisingly useful for predicting empirically maximal
stable learning rate exponents which provide useful guidance on optimal
learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis clarifies the effectiveness and
limitations of recently proposed layerwise learning rate scaling for standard
initialization.

Abstract: Designing protein sequences of both high fitness and novelty is a challenging
task in data-efficient protein engineering. Exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods often leads to biologically implausible sequences or relies on
surrogate models that lose fidelity in novel regions. Here, we propose
ProSpero, an active learning framework in which a frozen pre-trained generative
model is guided by a surrogate updated from oracle feedback. By integrating
fitness-relevant residue selection with biologically-constrained Sequential
Monte Carlo sampling, our approach enables exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods while preserving biological plausibility. We show that our
framework remains effective even when the surrogate is misspecified. ProSpero
consistently outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse protein
engineering tasks, retrieving sequences of both high fitness and novelty.

Abstract: Multi-task model merging aims to consolidate knowledge from multiple
fine-tuned task-specific experts into a unified model while minimizing
performance degradation. Existing methods primarily approach this by minimizing
differences between task-specific experts and the unified model, either from a
parameter-level or a task-loss perspective. However, parameter-level methods
exhibit a significant performance gap compared to the upper bound, while
task-loss approaches entail costly secondary training procedures. In contrast,
we observe that performance degradation closely correlates with feature drift,
i.e., differences in feature representations of the same sample caused by model
merging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Layer-wise Optimal Task
Vector Merging (LOT Merging), a technique that explicitly minimizes feature
drift between task-specific experts and the unified model in a layer-by-layer
manner. LOT Merging can be formulated as a convex quadratic optimization
problem, enabling us to analytically derive closed-form solutions for the
parameters of linear and normalization layers. Consequently, LOT Merging
achieves efficient model consolidation through basic matrix operations.
Extensive experiments across vision and vision-language benchmarks demonstrate
that LOT Merging significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving
improvements of up to 4.4% (ViT-B/32) over state-of-the-art approaches. The

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved
memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling
operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance.
However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking
potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard
isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the
highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In
this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an
optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment
orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace,
enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly
aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss
landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with
commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We
theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving
their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we
analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we
both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via
SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity.
Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances
stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20%
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In modern theoretical analyses of neural networks, the infinite-width limit
is often invoked to justify Gaussian approximations of neuron preactivations
(e.g., via neural network Gaussian processes or Tensor Programs). However,
these Gaussian-based asymptotic theories have so far been unable to capture the
behavior of attention layers, except under special regimes such as infinitely
many heads or tailored scaling schemes. In this paper, leveraging the Tensor
Programs framework, we rigorously identify the infinite-width limit
distribution of variables within a single attention layer under realistic
architectural dimensionality and standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-scaling with $n$
dimensionality. We derive the exact form of this limit law without resorting to
infinite-head approximations or tailored scalings, demonstrating that it
departs fundamentally from Gaussianity. This limiting distribution exhibits
non-Gaussianity from a hierarchical structure, being Gaussian conditional on
the random similarity scores. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical
predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our theory at finite width and
accurate description of finite-head attentions. Beyond characterizing a
standalone attention layer, our findings lay the groundwork for developing a
unified theory of deep Transformer architectures in the infinite-width regime.

Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools
for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across
diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability
of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph
structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and
deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we
study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a
novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that
focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation
characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This
way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on
the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and
perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing
baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on
downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the
proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data
distribution into stability analysis.

Abstract: The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a
fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe
release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring
traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline
for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category
completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder
(CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and
utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario
categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the
completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The
results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work.
The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to
maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose T2MIR (Token- and Task-wise MoE for In-context RL), an
innovative framework that introduces architectural advances of
mixture-of-experts (MoE) into transformer-based decision models. T2MIR
substitutes the feedforward layer with two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE
that captures distinct semantics of input tokens across multiple modalities,
and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse tasks to specialized experts for
managing a broad task distribution with alleviated gradient conflicts. To
enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a contrastive learning method that
maximizes the mutual information between the task and its router
representation, enabling more precise capture of task-relevant information. The
outputs of two MoE components are concatenated and fed into the next layer.
Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR significantly facilitates in-context
learning capacity and outperforms various types of baselines. We bring the
potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering a simple and scalable
architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer toward achievements
in language and vision communities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot

amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely

theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art for membership inference attacks on machine learning
models is a class of attacks based on shadow models that mimic the behavior of
the target model on subsets of held-out nonmember data. However, we find that
this class of attacks is fundamentally limited because of a key assumption --
that the shadow models can replicate the target model's behavior on the
distribution of interest. As a result, we show that attacks relying on shadow
models can fail catastrophically on critical AI safety applications where data
access is restricted due to legal, ethical, or logistical constraints, so that
the shadow models have no reasonable signal on the query examples. Although
this problem seems intractable within the shadow model paradigm, we find that
quantile regression attacks are a promising approach in this setting, as these
models learn features of member examples that can generalize to unseen classes.
We demonstrate this both empirically and theoretically, showing that quantile
regression attacks achieve up to 11x the TPR of shadow model-based approaches
in practice, and providing a theoretical model that outlines the generalization
properties required for this approach to succeed. Our work identifies an
important failure mode in existing MIAs and provides a cautionary tale for
practitioners that aim to directly use existing tools for real-world
applications of AI safety.

Abstract: We study realizable continual linear regression under random task orderings,
a common setting for developing continual learning theory. In this setup, the
worst-case expected loss after $k$ learning iterations admits a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/k)$. However, prior work using an unregularized scheme has only
established an upper bound of $O(1/k^{1/4})$, leaving a significant gap. Our
paper proves that this gap can be narrowed, or even closed, using two
frequently used regularization schemes: (1) explicit isotropic $\ell_2$
regularization, and (2) implicit regularization via finite step budgets. We
show that these approaches, which are used in practice to mitigate forgetting,
reduce to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on carefully defined surrogate
losses. Through this lens, we identify a fixed regularization strength that
yields a near-optimal rate of $O(\log k / k)$. Moreover, formalizing and
analyzing a generalized variant of SGD for time-varying functions, we derive an
increasing regularization strength schedule that provably achieves an optimal
rate of $O(1/k)$. This suggests that schedules that increase the regularization
coefficient or decrease the number of steps per task are beneficial, at least
in the worst case.

Abstract: The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and
energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of
time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts,
such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval
essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust
time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite
the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored.
Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous
modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To
address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds
time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained
channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate
semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval
modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking
linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving
semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative
context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a
static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder,
with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware
representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These
representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting
and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains
highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream
applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Abstract: Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a
crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One
prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to
overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent
supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical
disparities linking device measurement errors to patient outcomes in intensive
care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. This study causally
investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive
ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using
path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical
decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust
estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency,
and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on
semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets:
MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact
of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific
effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on
ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a
novel pipeline for investigating potential disparities in clinical
decision-making and, more importantly, highlights the necessity of causal
methods to robustly assess fairness in healthcare.

Abstract: Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales
predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we
develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental
complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using
the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that
combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore
meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable
loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models
when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of
whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised
fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem
complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient
descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.

Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet
something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to
rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the
initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different
models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing
distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to
predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon
the dataset. Intriguingly, we find that influence functions (IFs), a popular
data attribution tool, are 'secretly distributional': they emerge from our
framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation, without requiring
restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new perspective on the
effectiveness of IFs in deep learning. We demonstrate the practical utility of
d-TDA in experiments, including improving data pruning for vision transformers
and identifying influential examples with diffusion models.

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers
from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel
''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant
multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our
method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its
singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix
becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert
corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the
corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a
learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts'
orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix.
These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among
the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments
on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task
adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict-
and oblivion-resistance. The code of the experiments is available at
https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of
multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low
computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major
limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion,
preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse
domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to
dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across
domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework.
Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree
structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data
generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively
extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data
sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical
Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism
to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance
feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth
(IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target
LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT),
further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental
results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi
significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits
higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target
LLM's capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly compared to the activation degrees. Our proofs are
constructive and center on a connection between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor
decompositions, and Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems. We also settle an open
conjecture on the dimension of PNN's neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on
the activation degrees required for it to reach the expected dimension.

Abstract: Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in
this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward
passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold
during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence
level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We
introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual
importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model,
filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought
from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution
of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized
impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these
sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty
management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from
subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining
sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a
model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's
difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or
diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques
together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by
conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math
problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the
reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool
(thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further
problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of
sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction (FTP) and similar time series tasks typically
require capturing smooth latent dynamics hidden within noisy signals. However,
existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational
cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature.
This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to
extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely
integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By
leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators
analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's
core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent
interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design
philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws
(e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers
competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several
orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we
analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass
filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by
high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and
interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between

Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted
Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs,
which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces.
This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising
representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved
generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach
through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks,
showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a ``lightweight'' warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of
harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as
too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of
reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit
adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to
better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better
distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to
both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our
work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks
and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST),
a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while
demonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random
recurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture
integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs
working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units
with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir
hyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST
dynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to
these working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at
each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of
standard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries
benchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five
categories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five
categories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification
and anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term
forecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for
time-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to
transformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations
and sensitive event detection.

pruning redundant weights and activations, thereby reducing data movement.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable method for sparsification, applicable to linear layers in
all settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss (majority <2.25%). We show a 2.2x inference speedup
for Llama 3.2 with 16 GPUs, and up to 4.45x reduction in inference memory
footprint resulting in a 2.9x reduction in GPU setup and operating costs.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source
code, documentation, and usage examples are available at
github.com/Data-Science-in-Mechanical-Engineering/mixed_precision_for_JAX .

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and
calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to
concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data
reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work,
we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that
bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across
re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our
unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and
(2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary,
including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are
tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated
DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required
noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase
from 52% to 70% in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying
perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating
the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification,
attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

Abstract: How can large language models (LLMs) serve users with varying preferences
that may conflict across cultural, political, or other dimensions? To advance
this challenge, this paper establishes four key results. First, we demonstrate,
through a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from
five countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit significantly more variation in
preferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show
that existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for
learning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient
dimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity
of candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for
negatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that
simple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the
performance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth,
based on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source
Community Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and
multi-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons
from annotators spanning five countries. We hope that the Community Alignment
dataset will be a valuable resource for improving the effectiveness of LLMs for
a diverse global population.

Abstract: Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions, vegetation composition and
structure that support biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to
people. Most habitats face mounting pressures from human activities, which
requires accurate, high-resolution habitat mapping for effective conservation
and restoration. Yet, current habitat maps often fall short in thematic or
spatial resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive
habitat types that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class
imbalance that complicates exhaustive multi-class training. Here, we evaluated
how high-resolution remote sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
tools can improve habitat mapping across large geographical extents at fine
spatial and thematic resolution. Using vegetation plots from the European
Vegetation Archive, we modelled the distribution of Level 3 EUNIS habitat types
across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against independent
validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical nature of
habitat classifications resolved classification ambiguities, especially in
fragmented habitats. Integrating satellite-borne multispectral and radar
imagery, particularly through Earth Observation (EO) Foundation models
(EO-FMs), enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.
Finally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted
predictive accuracy even further. Our methodological framework is transferable
beyond Europe and adaptable to other classification systems. Future research
should advance temporal modelling of habitat dynamics, extend to habitat
segmentation and quality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired
with higher-quality in situ observations.

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional
pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate
schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent
alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight
averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay
phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at
the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable
alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],
which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show
that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape
without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable
for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we
conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it
implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this
analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to
momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key
limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model
training.

Abstract: Grounding language in perception and action is a key challenge when building
situated agents that can interact with humans, or other agents, via language.
In the past, addressing this challenge has required manually designing the
language grounding or curating massive datasets that associate language with
the environment. We propose Ground-Compose-Reinforce, an end-to-end,
neurosymbolic framework for training RL agents directly from high-level task
specifications--without manually designed reward functions or other
domain-specific oracles, and without massive datasets. These task
specifications take the form of Reward Machines, automata-based representations
that capture high-level task structure and are in some cases autoformalizable
from natural language. Critically, we show that Reward Machines can be grounded
using limited data by exploiting compositionality. Experiments in a custom
Meta-World domain with only 350 labelled pretraining trajectories show that our
framework faithfully elicits complex behaviours from high-level
specifications--including behaviours that never appear in pretraining--while
non-compositional approaches fail.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural
network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these
models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most
existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the
construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in
substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing
penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal
relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To
address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural
Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model
and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and
output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific
time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures
such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical
simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC
outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational
overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder
urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in
reconstructing gene regulatory networks.

Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model
based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity
and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking
in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{PhysGym}, a novel
benchmark suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based
scientific reasoning in interactive physics environments. \textsc{PhysGym}'s
primary contribution lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior
knowledge provided to the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent
performance along axes including the complexity of the problem and the prior
knowledge levels. The benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations,
where agents must actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under
constraints and formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws.
\textsc{PhysGym} provides standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for
assessing hypothesis accuracy and model fidelity. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by presenting results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its
ability to differentiate capabilities based on varying priors and task
complexity.

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) that cannot be solved analytically by learning mappings
between function spaces. However, there are two main bottlenecks in training
neural operators: they require a significant amount of training data to learn
these mappings, and this data needs to be labeled, which can only be accessed
via expensive simulations with numerical solvers. To alleviate both of these
issues simultaneously, we propose PICore, an unsupervised coreset selection
framework that identifies the most informative training samples without
requiring access to ground-truth PDE solutions. PICore leverages a
physics-informed loss to select unlabeled inputs by their potential
contribution to operator learning. After selecting a compact subset of inputs,
only those samples are simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels,
reducing annotation costs. We then train the neural operator on the reduced
labeled dataset, significantly decreasing training time as well. Across four
diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore
achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency relative to
supervised coreset selection methods with minimal changes in accuracy. We
provide code at https://github.com/Asatheesh6561/PICore.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term tactical decisions consistent with
long-term financial objectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to
such problems, but adoption is limited by myopic behaviour and opaque policies.
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and
multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts. This
paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading
strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of
LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of
LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD). Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves
both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.

Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,
relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions
over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,
difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a
flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.
However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and
stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To
address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft
attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven
approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network
architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on
simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies
were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant
to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion
of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of
the mean relative error with the best architectures found by 27.08%. These
advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into
an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely
data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, and
achieve improved settling times when compared to traditional MPC approaches,
yielding improvements of up to 62%, when subject to observation noise and RWs
friction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent
research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both
algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress,
several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized
guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their
underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings,
variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led
to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these
techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting
appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL
techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a
unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable
scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained
experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and
architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for
selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable
roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we
reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning
capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results
demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance,
surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

Abstract: We study cost-aware routing for large language models across diverse and
dynamic pools of models. Existing approaches often overlook prompt-specific
context, rely on expensive model profiling, assume a fixed set of experts, or
use inefficient trial-and-error strategies. We introduce Cost-Spectrum
Contrastive Routing (CSCR), a lightweight framework that maps both prompts and
models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection.
CSCR uses compact, fast-to-compute logit footprints for open-source models and
perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to
favor the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands. At inference
time, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no
retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.
Across multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving
the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen
LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.

Abstract: Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of
causal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods.
Under the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods
based on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal
of the log-densities. In this paper, we aim to improve the approximation of the
Hessian diagonal of the log-densities, thereby enhancing the performance of
ordering-based causal discovery algorithms. Existing approaches that rely on
Stein gradient estimators are computationally expensive and memory-intensive,
while diffusion-model-based methods remain unstable due to the second-order
derivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose
Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in
smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and
to preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results
show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by
31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining
memory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic
control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that
integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,
enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.
Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs
without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression setting,

induced on features by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel
definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for
depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through
executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal
specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the
study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving
correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only
establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but
also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four
generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT
problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective
functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known
depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while
providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT
problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm
and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree
algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The
results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible
splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support
algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those
with mixed splitting rules.

Abstract: Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is a notable phenomenon in the loss landscapes
of neural networks, wherein independently trained models have been observed to
be connected--up to permutation symmetries--by linear paths in parameter space
along which the loss remains consistently low. This observation challenges
classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model
ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry.
Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we
systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures--a class of models known for their scalability and computational
efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks--referred to as
experts--through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating
that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by
permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function.
Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that
enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the
discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using
our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations--including dense,
sparse, and shared-expert variants--under a wide range of model settings and
datasets of varying scales and modalities. Our results confirm the existence of
LMC in MoE architectures and offer fundamental insights into the functional
landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models.

Abstract: Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks
due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal
decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization
task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is
NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper
decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four
formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four
generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees
satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties
of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial
hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.
  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the
algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the
first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to
hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on
general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general
hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.
  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision
trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature
noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more
accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.
We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,
showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the
state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree
complexity is properly controlled.

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired
synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

Abstract: Dynamic GNNs, which integrate temporal and spatial features in
Electroencephalography (EEG) data, have shown great potential in automating
seizure detection. However, fully capturing the underlying dynamics necessary
to represent brain states, such as seizure and non-seizure, remains a
non-trivial task and presents two fundamental challenges. First, most existing
dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to
reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression.
Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures
and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in
inconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first
theoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and
necessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.
Building on these insights, we propose EvoBrain, a novel seizure detection
model that integrates a two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by
Laplacian Positional Encoding, following neurological insights. Moreover,
EvoBrain incorporates explicitly dynamic graph structures, allowing both nodes
and edges to evolve over time. Our contributions include (a) a theoretical
analysis proving the expressivity advantage of explicit dynamic modeling and
time-then-graph over other approaches, (b) a novel and efficient model that
significantly improves AUROC by 23% and F1 score by 30%, compared with the
dynamic GNN baseline, and (c) broad evaluations of our method on the
challenging early seizure prediction tasks.

Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged
as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In
this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model
discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression
(LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection
criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct
algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the
trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost.
While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the
$\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for
$\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and
anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental
datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform
consistently well in discovering isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding
highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable
discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a highly effective
technique for improving model generalization, but its underlying principles are
not fully understood. We investigated the phenomenon known as m-sharpness,
where the performance of SAM improves monotonically as the micro-batch size for
computing perturbations decreases. In practice, the empirical m-sharpness
effect underpins the deployment of SAM in distributed training, yet a rigorous
theoretical account has remained lacking. To provide a theoretical explanation
for m-sharpness, we leverage an extended Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)
framework and analyze the structure of stochastic gradient noise (SGN) to
characterize the dynamics of various SAM variants, including n-SAM and m-SAM.
Our findings reveal that the stochastic noise introduced during SAM
perturbations inherently induces a variance-based sharpness regularization
effect. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we introduce Reweighted SAM
(RW-SAM), which employs sharpness-weighted sampling to mimic the generalization
benefits of m-SAM while remaining parallelizable. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and proposed method.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated
learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing
participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant
distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and
intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation
methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging
approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to
handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly
alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning
attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model
updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of
other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously
show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers
are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical
need for more robust evaluation schemes.

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could significantly damage the performance and
robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on these datasets. As the
size of modern DNNs grows, there is a growing demand for automated tools for
detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc, model-agnostic noise
detection and rectification methods utilizing the penultimate feature from a
DNN. Our idea is based on the observation that the similarity between the
penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point and its true class data points
is higher than that for data points from other classes, making the probability
of label occurrence within a tight, similar cluster informative for detecting
and rectifying errors. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves high detection performance across
diverse, realistic noise scenarios and can automatically rectify these errors
to improve dataset quality. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: When some parameters of a constrained optimization problem (COP) are
uncertain, this gives rise to a predict-then-optimize (PtO) problem, comprising
two stages: the prediction of the unknown parameters from contextual
information and the subsequent optimization using those predicted parameters.
Decision-focused learning (DFL) implements the first stage by training a
machine learning (ML) model to optimize the quality of the decisions made using
the predicted parameters. When the predicted parameters occur in the
constraints, they can lead to infeasible solutions. Therefore, it is important
to simultaneously manage both feasibility and decision quality. We develop a
DFL framework for predicting constraint parameters in a generic COP. While
prior works typically assume that the underlying optimization problem is a
linear program (LP) or integer LP (ILP), our approach makes no such assumption.
We derive two novel loss functions based on maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE): the first one penalizes infeasibility (by penalizing predicted
parameters that lead to infeasible solutions), while the second one penalizes
suboptimal decisions (by penalizing predicted parameters that make the true
optimal solution infeasible). We introduce a single tunable parameter to form a
weighted average of the two losses, allowing decision-makers to balance
suboptimality and feasibility. We experimentally demonstrate that adjusting
this parameter provides decision-makers control over this trade-off. Moreover,
across several COP instances, we show that adjusting the tunable parameter
allows a decision-maker to prioritize either suboptimality or feasibility,
outperforming the performance of existing baselines in either objective.

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Within the Scenario stage we introduce a tail-weighted diffusion objective that

explicit budget, box, and turnover constraints, demonstrating the value of

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
high-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water

individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement. Our code is available on
GitHub, and the datasets and trained models are available on Hugging Face.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural
Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent
gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in
model merging.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient alternative to
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), yet it typically assumes
hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons. Such assumptions can be brittle
under noisy or distribution-shifted supervision. We present Anchored Direct
Preference Optimization (ADPO), which (i) incorporates soft preference
probabilities, (ii) aligns policy updates through reference anchoring that
induces an implicit trust region, and (iii) extends to listwise learning via
Plackett-Luce modeling. In controlled synthetic setups covering 12 scenarios (4
noise types x 3 severities) and 3 model scales, ADPO exhibits relative
improvements ranging from 12% to 79% over a standard DPO baseline (10-seed
means; 95% CIs in the Appendix). Hard labels tend to fare better under severe
noise, whereas soft labels yield better calibration under distribution shift;
listwise variants achieve the highest WinMass (expected probability mass on the
ground-truth best item) in 9/12 scenarios. Larger models amplify ADPO's
benefits (0.718 vs. 0.416 at hidden=256), suggesting that anchoring acts as an
effective trust-region regularizer. We release code and configurations to
facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.
