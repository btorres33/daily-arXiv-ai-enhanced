The powerful\nfocusing of the ion channel generally yields significantly higher gain\nparameters in the ICL as compared to the FEL. This permits lasing in extremely\nshort distances using electron bunches with an energy spread as large as a few\npercent; a value readily achievable with current plasma-based accelerators.\nICLs, however, impose stringent transverse phase space requirements on the\nelectron bunch beyond what is required in FELs. In this work, we present a\nnovel 3D theory of the planar off-axis configuration of the ICL that accounts\nfor a number of effects including diffraction, transverse radiation profile,\nfrequency and betatron phase detuning, and nonzero spread in energy and\nundulator parameter. We derive the ICL pendulum and field equations, which we\nuse to write down the 3D Maxwell-Klimontovich equations.

The 3D ICL dispersion relation is obtained using a Van Kampen\nnormal mode expansion.

After this\nreasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are\ndetermined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent\nindex ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination.

However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by\ndefault, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the\nreal-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability\nwhen an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has\npassed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often\neither over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or\nunder-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,\nwe introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across\n34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user\nquestion, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed\nsince the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue\nmessages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and\nevolving environments.

It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for\nthe needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical\naccidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant\nliterature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,\nresearchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence\nand generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to\nhandle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when\nqueries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may\nretrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this\nissue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better\nformat. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones\nand use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the\nmost important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly\nenhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\\%\nimprovement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method.

Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,\nsuch as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate\nprompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to\nspecific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors\nof LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.\nSpecifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input\nproblem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning\ncorrectness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the\ncalculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which\navoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated\nprompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method\nto reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance\nimprovements than other voting and verification methods with very few\ncomputational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales\nand model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It\nachieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from\nincorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning\nbenchmarks by more than 8%."}

We then\ninstantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of\nagents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an\nexisting approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;\n(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)\nfrom external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,\nextending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of\narguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two\nstandard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with\ntwo or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that\ncombining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in\nthe case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of\nevidence for claim verification."}

Our extensive analysis\nof 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,\nlarge language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous\narc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of\nbrain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within\nthis geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not\nmerely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes\nglobal semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme\nfacilitates deep fusion across different modalities.

Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three\nstages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing\nlookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that\nexhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic\nSampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves\nfinal pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy\nOptimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks.

To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL\napproach for developing critiquing language models without stronger\nsupervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor\ngenerates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the\nresponse accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward\nsignals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to\nunsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive\nfeedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response\nis high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.\nTo overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In\nstage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct\nrule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on\nactor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its\ndiscriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across\nvarious tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance\nimprovements.

However,\nwhen a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.\nDisambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS\nassociated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.\nThe problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language\nprocessing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,\nexpression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.\nLexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural\nlanguage processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce\nmultiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct\nsolution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence\nrate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is\nunrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a\nlexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate\nand implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal\ndescription of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation\ngrammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer\npaths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a\ncombination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by\nconsidering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling\nof a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come\nspontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often\ndue to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity.

Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert\nmultivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss\nto the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to\nachieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a\nreasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood\nassistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the\nreasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive\nexperiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive\nverify the superiorities of the TableTime."}

We have designed and\nproposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent\nInteraction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the\nMemory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction\nlayer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and\nagents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This\nensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As\nthe core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down\ncommunication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service\ndiscovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless\ninterconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,\noperates at the cognitive layer.

To mitigate this, we should be able to swap\nthe original LM tokenizer with an arbitrary one, on the fly, without degrading\nperformance. Hence, in this work we define a new problem: Zero-Shot Tokenizer\nTransfer (ZeTT). The challenge at the core of ZeTT is finding embeddings for\nthe tokens in the vocabulary of the new tokenizer. Since prior heuristics for\ninitializing embeddings often perform at chance level in a ZeTT setting, we\npropose a new solution: we train a hypernetwork taking a tokenizer as input and\npredicting the corresponding embeddings. We empirically demonstrate that the\nhypernetwork generalizes to new tokenizers both with encoder (e.g., XLM-R) and\ndecoder LLMs (e.g., Mistral-7B). Our method comes close to the original models'\nperformance in cross-lingual and coding tasks while markedly reducing the\nlength of the tokenized sequence.

Assuming that the LLM can\ngenerate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a\nrandom guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove\ntheoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero\nexponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as\nits test-time compute grows.

Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations:\nin-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the\nevaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not\napplicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is\na plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured\nreasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the\nevaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process\nof bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we\ndesign a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction,\nsupervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and\nintegration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging\nfrom 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all\nscales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon,\nand sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong\neffectiveness.

In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling\nbetween thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel\nsampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we\npropose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages\nmulti-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and\nefficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought\nadvantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.\nEmpirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA\nreduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and\ndiverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves\nperformance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that\nincreasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model\nperformance."}

This new paradigm of graph\nconstruction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token\nconsumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original\npassages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant\nentity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage\nretrieval through global importance aggregation.
