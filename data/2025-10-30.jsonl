Traditional agent-based or deep\nlearning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to\ncapture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative\nreasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical\nLLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level\nnarrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral\nexecution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent\nis employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in\nmotivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to\nconvert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module\nfurther grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive\nbehavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility\nEntropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility\nacross different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent\nexecutes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time\nintervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding\nthis multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic\ntrajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable\nrepresentations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic\nmobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven\nsimulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and\nsynthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents."}

However, these models\nremain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks.\nExisting approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity\nand often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel\nfor transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a\nmodular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through\nan agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception\nagent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively\ndistill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs)\ntailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM,\nwhich serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner\nengage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of\ntargeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on\nknowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate\nthat Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger\nend-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision\ntranslator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B\nVLM on challenging knowledge-based questions.

In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance generated by HAMLET, we designed an evaluation\nmethod to assess three primary aspects, including character performance,\nnarrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation\nshows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences."}

Based on\nour analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of\nEnglish, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at\nthe word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram\nprobability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,\nand the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we\nsee consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted\nprobabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for\nincreasing $n$ over the course of training.

Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

We offer a\nmechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal\nstates across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A\nsimple linear probe decodes the internal \"solvability belief\" of a model,\nrevealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and\nacross math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -\nalthough belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear\neffective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the\nsubsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold.

To better\nunderstand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition\nunder which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational\nmotif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential\nstate converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any\ncontrol condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer\nintrospection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only\nindirectly afforded.

This study proposes a Hierarchical\nLLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level\nnarrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral\nexecution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent\nis employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in\nmotivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to\nconvert narratives into machine-readable plans.

In the\nbroader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to\nsynthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and\nvalidates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat\nRescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming\napproach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct\nLLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,\nModerate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and\nparaphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited\ntranscripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic\ndegradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,\nword count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on\nthe results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune\nmodels for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and\nusefulness of the synthetic transcripts."}

This technical report bridges this gap by developing a\ncomputational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic\ncoopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer\nsystem with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation\ntracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where\ncooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating\nhysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We\ndevelop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to\ninstantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and\norganizational contexts.

Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem\nproving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by\nleveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean\nprojects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not\nreadily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model\nachieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging\nbenchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for\nformal mathematics."}

We introduce a framework that\nsituates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,\nthereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in\nqualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present\nthe state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all\npublished social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a\ntool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models\nexpansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into\nmanageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable\nundergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and\nselectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under\nsupervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving\ntransparency and reliability."}

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand.

Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This\nmotivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond\ntext-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs."}

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of\nthe available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference\nrequires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids\nunnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word\nproblems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in\nsemantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked\naccuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent\ndistractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through\nirrelevant inferences."}

The top-performing open-source\nmodel, Llama 3.3 70B, is validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness\nof our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides\na reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific\ntraining needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust\ntestbed for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient\npresentations and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.

This study investigates how\nLLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through\ncontinuation and response tasks using three open-source models: Gemma, Llama3\nand Llama3.3 and one commercial Model:Claude. By analyzing climate change\ndiscussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions,\nintensity patterns, and semantic consistency between human-authored and\nLLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high\nsemantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: these models show\na strong tendency to moderate negative emotions. When the input text carries\nnegative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness, LLM tends to\ngenerate content with more neutral emotions, or even convert them into positive\nemotions such as joy or surprise. At the same time, we compared the\nLLM-generated content with human-authored content. The four models\nsystematically generated responses with reduced emotional intensity and showed\na preference for neutral rational emotions in the response task. In addition,\nthese models all maintained a high semantic similarity with the original text,\nalthough their performance in the continuation task and the response task was\ndifferent. These findings provide deep insights into the emotion and semantic\nprocessing capabilities of LLM, which are of great significance for its\ndeployment in social media environments and human-computer interaction design."}
