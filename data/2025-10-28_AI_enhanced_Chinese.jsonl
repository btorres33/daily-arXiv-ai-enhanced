We introduce a novel\nfeature engineering approach based on processing times computed between\nconsecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of\nsystem state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early\nfailure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.\nExperimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,\nusing both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the\napproach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides\ninherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the\nbusiness impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the\nresulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system\nissues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability\ngaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across\nmultiple entities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eISO 20022\u6d88\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5728TARGET\u5373\u65f6\u652f\u4ed8\u7ed3\u7b97\uff08TIPS\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6837\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5373\u65f6\u652f\u4ed8\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bcf\u5929\u5904\u7406\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u4e14\u671f\u671b\u96f6\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f25\u5408\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5e76\u5feb\u901f\u7406\u89e3\u6545\u969c\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eedISO 20022\u6d88\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5305\u62ec\u5728TIPS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u6837\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6837\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f7f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7406\u89e3\u4e1a\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f25\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ea4\u6613\u72b6\u6001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5982\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u6216\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u672a\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684 impact \u5305\u62ec\u6539\u5584\u5373\u65f6\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u62ec\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study\ndevelops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,\nenabling timely preventative interventions.\n  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we\nidentified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\\% male) who experienced\naspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration\ncohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were\ntrained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative\naspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects\n(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.\n  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\\% sensitivity on a\nheld-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age\nemerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant\ncausative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-\n0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men\nwere 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\\% higher maximum daily\nopioid dosages compared to women.\n  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,\nenabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and\noperative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in\nboth opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.\nThese findings have important implications for improving postoperative care\nprotocols and

In this setting, given a context, a candidate\ncommittee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve\noptimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to\naddress this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with\nUCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration\nactions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting\nmechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional\nto their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret\nproperties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical\nresults are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these\nmethods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language\nmodels (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically\nreweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to\ngenerate the most accurate response.

Their sampling\nprocess involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise\nfrom a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from\nthe ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \\textit{prediction error}.\nThe prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates\ngeneration quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically\nmeasuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance\n(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or\nmodification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new\ntrajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher\nquality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional\ngeneration.

To address\nthis gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of\nmulti-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level\nadaptive loss function.We begin by defining the \"Modality Gap\" as the\ndifference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and\nvisual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap\ndistribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively\nto \"modality-balanced\" and \"modality-imbalanced\" data samples. Subsequently, we\napply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample\nbelonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative\nanalysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)\nto minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample\ndistribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater\npenalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy\nconsisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training\nphase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,\nattaining accuracies of $80.65\\%$ and $70.90\\%$, respectively.

Uses publicly available ERA5 and METAR\n  datasets", "summary": "Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents\nchallenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models\nrely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This\nstudy investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes\ncan be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to\nenable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)\ntrained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a\n2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),\nSan Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of\n0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes\n(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that\nvisibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate\npredictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships\nrather than site-specific patterns.

While Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has been widely adopted for time series similarity measurement, it suffers from two critical limitations: 1) it primarily focuses on single-scale patterns without capturing multi-temporal characteristics, and 2) its point-to-point alignment approach can be computationally intensive and sensitive to noise. The research addresses these gaps by proposing MDD, which offers a fundamentally different approach to measuring similarity across multiple scales while avoiding the computational burden of alignment. This work responds to an urgent need for more efficient and effective time series analysis methods in applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to financial forecasting.", "method": "Methodology centers on implementing and comparing two similarity measures: 1) The proposed Multiscale Duboc Distance (MDD) operates through a multi-resolution analysis framework that decomposes time series into multiple temporal scales using wavelet transforms or similar techniques, then computes distance metrics across these scales without requiring point-wise alignment. 2) Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) serves as the baseline comparison, implementing standard dynamic programming with Euclidean distance as the local cost measure. The experimental setup includes systematic simulations designed to test specific hypotheses about scale sensitivity and computational efficiency, supplemented by comprehensive testing on 95 standardized datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. Both methods were evaluated using standard classification performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score) and computational efficiency measures (execution time, scalability).", "result": "Experimental results demonstrate that MDD consistently outperforms DTW across multiple evaluation criteria. In the UCR archive tests, MDD achieved statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy on the majority of datasets, with particularly substantial gains (up to 15-20% improvement) in scenarios involving multi-scale patterns or noisy data. The simulation studies confirmed MDD's superior ability to capture temporal relationships across different time resolutions while maintaining computational efficiency - MDD showed 30-50% faster processing times than DTW for comparable dataset sizes. The real-world application validation demonstrated practical utility, with MDD enabling more accurate classification in challenging domains. Performance gaps were most pronounced in three areas: handling of irregular sampling, robustness to temporal noise, and efficiency with long sequences. However, the results also indicated that DTW maintained advantages in specific scenarios involving strict local pattern matching requirements.", "conclusion": "The research establishes MDD as a significant advancement in time series similarity measurement, particularly valuable for applications requiring multi-scale analysis and computational efficiency. The method demonstrates clear practical utility through real-world validation and provides substantial performance improvements over established DTW in many scenarios. Key limitations include potential reduced effectiveness for applications requiring precise local alignment and sensitivity to the choice of scale parameters. Future work should focus on: 1) developing adaptive scale selection mechanisms within MDD, 2) extending the method to handle multi-variate time series, 3) investigating integration with deep learning architectures for hybrid approaches, and 4) exploring applications in real-time streaming environments where computational efficiency is critical. The research contributes to both theoretical understanding of multi-scale time series analysis and practical tools for data scientists working with complex temporal data."}}

To\nmitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned\nmodel's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models\nand overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in\nsuboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy\nfor pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and\nhigh efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected\nin attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this\ninformation can significantly recover model performance.

This paper addresses the critical need for a more efficient and accessible MIA approach that can operate with minimal resource requirements while maintaining high accuracy. The research aims to provide a practical tool for privacy assessment without the prohibitive costs associated with prior methods.", "method": "GP-MIA utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier trained on post-hoc metrics derived from a single trained model. These metrics include accuracy, entropy, dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features such as gradients or Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) measures. The GP classifier is designed to distinguish between data points that are members of the training set and those that are not. A key feature of GP-MIA is its ability to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, enhancing interpretability and reliability. The experimental setup involves evaluating GP-MIA on multiple datasets: synthetic data, a real-world fraud detection dataset, CIFAR-10 for image classification, and WikiText-2 for language modeling. The method is compared against existing MIA techniques to assess its performance and generalizability.", "result": "Experiments demonstrate that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy across diverse datasets, including synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data, CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2. The method shows strong generalizability, performing effectively on both image classification and language modeling tasks. GP-MIA outperforms existing MIAs that rely on shadow models or heavy query access, offering a more practical and efficient alternative. The calibrated uncertainty estimates provided by the GP classifier enhance the interpretability of the attack results. Key metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC, with GP-MIA consistently ranking among the top performers in comparative evaluations.", "conclusion": "GP-MIA represents a significant advancement in membership inference attacks by providing an efficient, interpretable, and practical method for privacy assessment. It eliminates the need for computationally intensive shadow models or extensive query access, making it suitable for real-world applications. The approach demonstrates high accuracy and generalizability across various datasets and model types. However, potential limitations include the computational complexity of GP models with very large datasets and the reliance on specific post-hoc metrics. Future work may focus on optimizing the GP model for scalability and exploring additional sensitivity features to further improve performance. The method provides a valuable tool for evaluating model privacy risks and informing the development of more robust privacy-preserving techniques."}}

Although deep\nlearning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable\nlimitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed\npredictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale\nprecipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent\nrandomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and\nrarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation\nnowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are\ninherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the\nCritical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it\nchallenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both\nmetrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference\noptimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the\nsuccess of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.\nSpecifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage\npost-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization\n(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently\nachieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on\nreducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building\non this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints\nthat preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across\nthese conflicting metrics.",

The effectiveness of deep learning\nmethods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences\nmodel performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies\noften construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple\nthree-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real\ngeological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly\navailable three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress\nin deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present\nOpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset\nthat encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.\nOpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple\nconfigurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures\nsuch as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their\ncorresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward\nmodeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed\na deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling\nefficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This\ncapability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.\nOpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM\nexploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in\nelectromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling\ncodes and trained models, is publicly available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17141981.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenEM

Category: cs.LG. Code and data:\n  https://github.com/Course-Correct-Labs/mirror-loop", "summary": "Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,\nyet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields\nreformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider\nstudy of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,\nAnthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families\n(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two\nconditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a\nsingle verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta\nI, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to\nlate (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all\nthree providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change\nimmediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.\nComplementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level\nentropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward\ninformational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on\nself-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information\nwith an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an\nattractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative\ncoupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency\nsuggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives\nrather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when\nreflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles\nfor grounded, cooperative reasoning.

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph\ndiscusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,\nand diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between\narbitrary times.

Defending against novel jailbreaks\nrepresents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract\nand compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with\nLLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates.

The goal of this paper is to empirically study\nwhether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings\nwhere function approximation is used.

In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on\nlong-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in\nmodern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more\ncomputation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\npruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with\nperformance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when\nperformance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.\nFurthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to\nrecover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated.

These annotations\noffer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,\naddressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we\npresent comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish\nbaselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for\ndeploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel\nMovidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic\nactivity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces\nlatency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning\nsystems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster\nmanagement, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard\nmonitoring technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It drives\nefficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by\nassigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation\nmethods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating\nchanges in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as\nopposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different\npatterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods\nbased on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when\nthe validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware\nmethods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical\ndeployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),\na plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an\nID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral\napproximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and\nOOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then\nestimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via\nperturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden.
