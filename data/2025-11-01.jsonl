In this study, we employ Reinforcement\nLearning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to\nimprove the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To\nachieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering\ndataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer\npairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and\nstudent models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we\ncompiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.\nThis dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million\ntokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly\nenhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the\nresulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on\napproximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.\nThese results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused\ntraining approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited\ndata availability."}
