We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

Quality is assessed using a\nmulti-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance\nin alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and\nautomated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and\ntopical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining\nretrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,\nautosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating\nlong-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future\nresearch on automated scholarly writing.

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC.

Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods."}

Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection\nRegulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts\nare expressed in unstructured natural language.

To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework\nthat represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a\nContext Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes\nnormative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes\nevents as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This\nalignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in\nstructured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation\nand event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments\non 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,\nGraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than\nLLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting\nin higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points.

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation."}

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value.

As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies.

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,\nlength or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without\npre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human\nFeedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.\nWIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring\nand (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7\ndatasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that\naccount for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by\nblack-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,\nand the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer\ninformality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.\nWIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users\ntend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned\nfeatures enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in\nArena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.\nThey also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment\ndataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that\nimprove preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method\nfor practitioners to better understand and use preference data."}

ZSB is simple and flexible: it requires only the\ncreation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation; it is scalable\nto tasks and languages where collecting real-world data is costly or\nimpractical; it is model-agnostic, allowing the creation of increasingly\nchallenging benchmarks as models improve.

Although numerous studies have attempted to evaluate\nthese risks, a comprehensive and systematic survey on safety evaluation of LLMs\nis still lacking. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting a structured\noverview of recent advances in safety evaluation of LLMs. Specifically, we\npropose a four-dimensional taxonomy: (i) Why to evaluate, which explores the\nbackground of safety evaluation of LLMs, how they differ from general LLMs\nevaluation, and the significance of such evaluation; (ii) What to evaluate,\nwhich examines and categorizes existing safety evaluation tasks based on key\ncapabilities, including dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias\nand fairness, truthfulness, and related aspects; (iii) Where to evaluate, which\nsummarizes the evaluation metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in\nsafety evaluations; (iv) How to evaluate, which reviews existing mainstream\nevaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators and some evaluation\nframeworks that integrate the entire evaluation pipeline. Finally, we identify\nthe challenges in safety evaluation of LLMs and propose promising research\ndirections to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize the\nnecessity of prioritizing safety evaluation to ensure the reliable and\nresponsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications."}
